# Future Enhancements

The following features could be valuable in future iterations but are deferred from the initial implementation:

## V2.0 Potential Features

**Multi-University Batch Processing**
- Extend configuration to support multiple universities
- Parallel university analysis with consolidated rankings
- Cross-university comparison reports

**Historical Tracking**
- Re-run analysis periodically (quarterly, semi-annually)
- Track changes in lab activity over time
- Identify trending labs (increasing publication rate, new collaborations)
- Alert on significant changes (new positions, PI departures)

**Enhanced Communication Tools**
- Email template generation for top labs
- Personalized message suggestions based on research alignment
- Contact timing recommendations based on academic calendar
- Follow-up tracking and reminder system

**Expanded Intelligence**
- Grant funding data integration (NIH Reporter, NSF Awards)
- Conference presentation analysis (recent talks, keynotes)
- Social media presence assessment (Twitter/X, ResearchGate activity)
- Lab culture signals (diversity statements, work-life balance mentions)
- Alumni placement tracking (where do PhD graduates go?)

**Improved User Experience**
- Simple web UI for configuration and report viewing
- Interactive filtering and sorting of results
- Visual charts for publication trends, collaboration networks
- Export to additional formats (PDF, Excel, JSON)

**Advanced Analysis**
- Network analysis to identify "clusters" of related labs
- Citation impact analysis beyond journal reputation
- Collaboration strength scoring (depth vs. breadth)
- Research trajectory analysis (evolving vs. stable focus)

## Implementation Priority

If pursuing future enhancements, recommended priority order:

1. **Historical Tracking** (High Value) - Provides ongoing utility beyond one-time use
2. **Enhanced Communication Tools** (High Value) - Direct support for taking action on results
3. **Multi-University Support** (Medium Value) - Useful for students considering multiple schools
4. **Expanded Intelligence** (Medium Value) - Deeper insights but diminishing returns
5. **Improved User Experience** (Low-Medium Value) - Quality of life improvements
6. **Advanced Analysis** (Low Value) - Interesting but not critical
