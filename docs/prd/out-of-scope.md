# Out of Scope

The following features and capabilities are explicitly **not included** in this project:

## Multi-University Support
- ❌ Batch processing of multiple universities in a single run
- ❌ Cross-university comparison or aggregated rankings
- ❌ University recommendation engine

**Rationale:** This is a focused tool for deep analysis of a single target university. Multi-university support would significantly increase complexity and reduce depth of analysis.

## Automation & Monitoring
- ❌ Real-time monitoring or alerts for new position openings
- ❌ Scheduled re-runs or periodic updates
- ❌ Automated email outreach to professors
- ❌ Calendar integration for application deadline tracking

**Rationale:** This is a one-off execution tool. Continuous monitoring and automation features would require infrastructure (databases, scheduling, notification systems) beyond project scope.

## Machine Learning & Personalization
- ❌ ML-based personalization or recommendation refinement
- ❌ Learning from user feedback to improve future rankings
- ❌ Predictive models for position availability or acceptance likelihood

**Rationale:** As a one-off tool, there's no training data or feedback loop to support ML features. Current LLM-based scoring is sufficient.

## User Interface
- ❌ Web UI or dashboard
- ❌ Interactive visualizations
- ❌ Mobile application
- ❌ Browser extension

**Rationale:** CLI-only approach keeps the project focused and implementable. Markdown reports provide sufficient readability.

## Collaborative Features
- ❌ Multi-user support or user accounts
- ❌ Sharing results with peers
- ❌ Collaborative filtering or crowdsourced ratings
- ❌ Discussion forums or commenting on labs

**Rationale:** Single-user personal tool; collaboration features unnecessary.

## Integration Features
- ❌ Integration with application tracking systems
- ❌ Export to CRM or applicant management tools
- ❌ API for external tools to consume results
- ❌ Integration with email clients for outreach

**Rationale:** Markdown reports provide sufficient output format. Additional integrations add complexity without clear value for personal use.

## Advanced Data Collection
- ❌ Sentiment analysis of lab member reviews (e.g., Glassdoor-style)
- ❌ Grant funding analysis
- ❌ Patent portfolio analysis
- ❌ Teaching load or course assignment data
- ❌ Lab culture assessment from social media

**Rationale:** These would require additional data sources and analysis complexity. Current data sources provide sufficient signals for fitness assessment.
