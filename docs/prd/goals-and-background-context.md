# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable efficient identification of best-fit research labs based on user's academic profile and research interests
- Automate professor and lab discovery process within a target university
- Provide comprehensive lab intelligence including recent publications, collaborations, and team composition
- Identify potential position openings through graduating PhD detection
- Assess lab engagement levels through authorship pattern analysis (first author vs. nth author, core vs. collaborator roles)
- Generate ranked reports to facilitate informed lab selection decisions

## Background Context

Finding the right research lab is a time-consuming process that requires synthesizing information from multiple sources: professor directories, lab websites, recent publications, and team member profiles. This tool addresses the need for a systematic, automated approach to lab research by leveraging the Claude Agent SDK's web scraping capabilities.

The system consolidates a user's academic profile (resume, degree program, research interests) to create a baseline for relevance matching, then systematically discovers, filters, and analyzes labs within a target university. By examining website freshness, publication patterns, authorship roles, and team composition, it provides actionable intelligence about lab activity levels and potential opportunities. The output is a ranked overview with detailed per-lab reports to support decision-making.
