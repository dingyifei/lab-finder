# Story 8.4: Detailed Individual Lab Reports

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** detailed reports for each lab in a dedicated directory,
**so that** I can deep-dive into specific labs of interest.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Individual lab report generated for each analyzed lab (FR29)
2. Reports saved to ./labs/ directory
3. Each report includes: PI profile, lab overview, recent publications (with abstracts), lab members, authorship analysis, collaboration network, fitness scoring breakdown, contact information, data quality flags
4. Reports named consistently (e.g., labs/PI-name-department.md)
5. Internal links from Overview.md to detailed reports
6. Markdown formatting for readability
7. Reports self-contained (can be read independently)
