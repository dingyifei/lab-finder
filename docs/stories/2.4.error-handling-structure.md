# Story 2.4: Error Handling for Missing Structure Data

## Status

**Done** (Completed 2025-10-07)

**Completion Note:** Error handling successfully adapted to Claude Agent SDK pattern. All error handling capabilities preserved and enhanced. Architectural alignment with Story 2.1 achieved. QA Gate: PASS (100/100).

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** the system to handle cases where department structure is unclear or incomplete,
**so that** analysis continues with graceful degradation instead of failing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System identifies when structure discovery is incomplete or ambiguous (NFR13)
2. User notified of structure gaps with specific details
3. Partial structure data saved and used where available
4. Fallback: Process all discoverable departments even if hierarchy unclear
5. Data quality issues flagged in output (FR32)
6. Detailed logging of what couldn't be discovered (NFR17)

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Prerequisites

**Required Completed Stories:**
- **Story 1.4** - Shared Utilities Implementation
  - Provides: `checkpoint_manager.py`, `logger.py` (structlog configuration)
  - Required for: Error logging, checkpoint persistence
- **Story 2.1** - University Website Structure Discovery (if implementing as enhancement)
  - Provides: `src/agents/university_discovery.py`, `src/models/department.py` base implementation
  - Required for: Modifying existing discovery agent with error handling

**Note:** This story can be implemented in parallel with Story 2.1 if both start from scratch, OR after Story 2.1 if enhancing existing implementation.

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Component:** University Structure Discovery Agent - Error Handling Module (Epic 2)

**Responsibility:** Graceful degradation for incomplete structure data (Epic 2, NFR13, FR32)

**Key Interfaces:**
- `validate_department_structure(departments: list[Department]) -> ValidationResult`
- `apply_fallback_strategy(departments: list[Department]) -> list[Department]`

**Dependencies:**
- Structured Logger for error and warning logging (Story 1.7)
- Checkpoint Manager for saving partial results (Story 1.7)
- Department Pydantic model with data_quality_flags (Story 2.1, updated in 2.4)

**Technology Stack:**
- tenacity for retry logic with exponential backoff
- structlog for structured error logging
- Pydantic for data validation

**Source Tree Location:**
- Modify: `src/agents/university_discovery.py` (add error handling logic)
- Modify: `src/models/department.py` (add data_quality_flags field)
- Create: `output/structure-gaps.md` (gap report)
- Create: `output/structure-validation.json` (validation results)
- Optional: `config/departments_fallback.json` (manual fallback)

**Updated Department Model:**
```python
class Department(BaseModel):
    id: str  # Unique identifier (generated)
    name: str  # Department name
    school: Optional[str] = None  # Parent school/college
    division: Optional[str] = None  # Parent division
    url: str  # Department homepage URL
    hierarchy_level: int  # Depth in organizational tree
    is_relevant: bool = False  # Result of relevance filtering (Story 2.3)
    relevance_reasoning: str = ""  # LLM explanation (Story 2.3)
    data_quality_flags: list[str] = []  # Data quality issues (Story 2.4)
```

**Data Quality Flags:**

Define as constant set for consistency and typo prevention:
```python
DATA_QUALITY_FLAGS = {
    "missing_url",           # Department URL not found
    "missing_school",        # School name unknown (using placeholder)
    "ambiguous_hierarchy",   # Hierarchy level unclear
    "partial_metadata",      # Some fields missing
    "inference_based",       # Information inferred not scraped
    "manual_entry",          # From manual fallback config
    "scraping_failed"        # Web scraping failed, using fallback
}
```

**Flag Descriptions:**
- `missing_url` - Department URL not found
- `missing_school` - School name unknown (using placeholder)
- `ambiguous_hierarchy` - Hierarchy level unclear
- `partial_metadata` - Some fields missing
- `inference_based` - Information inferred not scraped
- `manual_entry` - From manual fallback config
- `scraping_failed` - Web scraping failed, using fallback

**Error Handling Pattern (from Architecture):**
- **Retry Policy:** Exponential backoff with jitter (tenacity library)
  - Max retries: 3
  - Initial delay: 1 second
  - Backoff multiplier: 2x
  - Max delay: 10 seconds
- **Timeout Configuration:** Web scraping: 30 seconds per page
- **Error Translation:**
  - HTTP 404 (Not Found) → Flag as missing data, continue
  - Network timeouts → Retry with exponential backoff
  - HTML parsing failures → Apply fallback selectors, then flag

**Fallback Strategy Decision Tree:**
```
1. Try primary web scraping (built-in tools)
   ↓ (failure)
2. Try Playwright fallback
   ↓ (failure)
3. Apply graceful degradation:
   - Use partial data if available
   - Apply placeholders for missing fields
   - Flag with data_quality_flags
   ↓ (complete failure)
4. Check for manual fallback config
   ↓ (not found)
5. Skip department with ERROR log, continue with others
```

**Critical Rules (from Coding Standards):**
- Never crash pipeline on missing data - always degrade gracefully
- Always log failures with sufficient context for debugging
- Use data quality flags to surface issues to user
- Never use print() for logging (use structlog)

**Architecture Component Diagram Flow:**
```
University Discovery Agent → Web Scraping (with retries)
  ↓ (on failure)
University Discovery Agent → Fallback Strategy
  ↓
University Discovery Agent → Data Quality Flags (mark issues)
  ↓
University Discovery Agent → Logger (log all failures)
  ↓
University Discovery Agent → File System (save gap report)
```

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `tests/unit/test_error_handling_structure.py`

**Testing Standards:**
- Framework: pytest 7.4.4
- Mock web scraping failures
- Coverage requirement: 70% minimum

**Test Requirements:**
1. Test detection of incomplete structure (missing fields)
2. Test graceful degradation (partial data handling)
3. Test data quality flag application
4. Test structure gap report generation
5. Test manual fallback config loading
6. Test retry logic for transient failures
7. Test validation of discovered structure
8. Test error logging for all failure scenarios

**Example Test Pattern:**
```python
def test_graceful_degradation_missing_url(mocker):
    # Arrange
    mock_scrape = mocker.patch('src.agents.university_discovery.scrape_page')
    mock_scrape.return_value = {"name": "CS", "school": "Engineering", "url": None}

    agent = UniversityDiscoveryAgent()

    # Act
    departments = agent.discover_structure("https://test.edu")

    # Assert
    assert len(departments) == 1
    assert departments[0].name == "CS"
    assert departments[0].url == ""  # Fallback empty string
    assert "missing_url" in departments[0].data_quality_flags
```

### Review Date: 2025-10-07 (Post-Refactoring)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Refactoring Assessment

**Context:** Story 2.4 (Error Handling) shares the same `university_discovery.py` implementation as Story 2.1. The architectural refactoring to Claude Agent SDK pattern benefits both stories equally.

**Refactoring Quality: Excellent** ✅

All error handling capabilities preserved while gaining architectural alignment and code simplicity benefits.

**Error Handling Preserved:**
- ✅ Graceful degradation for missing data (school="Unknown School", partial metadata)
- ✅ Data quality flags tracking (`missing_url`, `missing_school`, `partial_metadata`, etc.)
- ✅ Manual fallback configuration support (`_load_manual_fallback()`)
- ✅ Validation with 50% thresholds (blocks pipeline if <50% completeness)
- ✅ Structure gap report generation (`generate_structure_gap_report()`)
- ✅ Comprehensive structured logging with correlation IDs

**Error Handling Improvements:**
- SDK provides better error abstractions (no direct HTTP exceptions to handle)
- Simplified error paths: SDK failure → manual fallback → re-raise
- Removed complex retry logic (tenacity decorators) - SDK handles internally
- Better separation: parsing errors vs. fetching errors

### Changes from SDK Refactoring

**Code Changes Shared with Story 2.1:**
1. ✅ SDK-based discovery replaces direct httpx/Playwright calls
2. ✅ Error handling simplified - SDK manages retry/timeout internally
3. ✅ Manual fallback preserved for graceful degradation
4. ✅ All data quality flag logic preserved

**Error Scenarios Tested (Post-Refactoring):**
- ✅ SDK failure with manual fallback: `test_discover_structure_sdk_failure_uses_fallback`
- ✅ Empty/no departments response: `test_discover_structure_no_departments_in_response`
- ✅ JSON parsing errors handled gracefully in `_parse_sdk_response()`
- ✅ Validation failures trigger appropriate errors

**Obsolete Tests (Properly Skipped):**
- 7 tests testing direct HTTP error handling marked as skipped
- Clear skip reasons document why tests are no longer applicable
- All skipped tests were testing implementation details (httpx/Playwright exceptions)

### Compliance Check (Post-Refactoring)

- **Coding Standards:** ✅ PASS - Error handling follows SDK best practices
- **Project Structure:** ✅ PASS - Clean error handling separation
- **Testing Strategy:** ✅ PASS - Comprehensive error scenarios covered; 232 tests passing
- **Error Handling Requirements:** ✅ PASS - All Story 2.4 requirements fully met
- **All ACs Met:** ✅ PASS - All 6 acceptance criteria satisfied

### Test Results Validation

**Coverage:** 93.53% overall (90% for university_discovery.py)
- All error handling paths covered
- Edge cases tested (empty responses, parsing errors, SDK failures)
- Manual fallback scenarios validated

**Test Quality:**
- Error scenarios properly mocked with SDK pattern
- Skip reasons clearly documented for obsolete tests
- No test quality degradation from refactoring

### Security Review (Post-Refactoring)

**Status:** ✅ PASS

Error handling maintains security posture:
- No error message information leakage
- SDK provides additional error isolation
- Structured logging still masks credentials

### Performance Considerations (Post-Refactoring)

**Status:** ✅ IMPROVED

- SDK error handling more efficient than manual retry decorators
- Fewer exception handling layers
- Better error recovery strategies built into SDK

### Reliability Impact

**Status:** ✅ ENHANCED

Error handling reliability improved through:
- SDK battle-tested error handling logic
- Consistent error patterns across all stories
- Better error observability via structured logging
- Preserved manual fallback as last resort

### Code Quality Improvements

**Error Handling Simplification:**
- Removed tenacity decorators and custom retry logic
- Single try-except block vs. multiple nested exception handlers
- Clearer error flow: SDK → Parse → Fallback → Re-raise
- More maintainable: fewer error paths to test

**Preserved Data Quality Tracking:**
- All data quality flags still applied correctly
- Gap reporting unchanged
- Validation thresholds enforced identically

### Files Modified During Review

None - all refactoring completed by Dev agent. Type hint fix in Story 2.1 applies to shared implementation.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → `docs/qa/gates/2.4-error-handling-structure.yml`

**Quality Score: 100/100**

All error handling requirements met. SDK refactoring improved code quality while preserving all error handling capabilities.

### Review Date: 2025-10-08 (Third Independent Review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXEMPLARY** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Story 2.4 continues to demonstrate exceptional quality after a fresh independent review. The error handling infrastructure is production-ready with comprehensive graceful degradation, data quality tracking, and user-facing diagnostics.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Robust error recovery:** Claude Agent SDK integration with manual fallback preserves all error handling capabilities
- **Data quality transparency:** 7 distinct quality flags provide fine-grained issue tracking
- **User-centric design:** Structure gap reports and validation results give users actionable feedback
- **Test completeness:** 36 tests (29 active, 7 properly skipped) with 100% coverage of error handling paths
- **Architecture alignment:** Shared implementation with Story 2.1 eliminates duplication and ensures consistency

### Refactoring Performed

**Type Annotation Improvements:**

- **File**: `src/agents/university_discovery.py`
  - **Line 106**: Added `dict[str, Any]` type parameter to `_apply_graceful_degradation()` parameter
  - **Line 164**: Added `dict[str, Any]` type parameter to `run_discovery_workflow()` parameter
  - **Line 1183**: Added `dict[str, Any]` type parameter to `filter_departments()` parameter
  - **Why**: Mypy strict mode requires explicit generic type parameters for dict annotations
  - **How**: Specified `dict[str, Any]` to match Python 3.11 generic syntax and improve type safety
  - **Impact**: Eliminates 3 mypy type-arg errors; improves IDE autocomplete and type checking

- **Tests**: `test_load_manual_fallback_*`, `test_discover_structure_sdk_failure_uses_fallback` (5 tests) ✅

**AC5: Data quality issues flagged in output**
- **Given** Data quality issues during discovery
- **When** Flags added via `add_quality_flag()`
- **Then** Flags validated against DATA_QUALITY_FLAGS, duplicates prevented, included in checkpoints/reports
- **Tests**: `test_add_quality_flag_*`, `test_has_quality_issues_*`, `test_department_data_quality_flags` (7 tests) ✅

**AC6: Detailed logging of failures**
- **Given** Discovery failures (SDK errors, timeouts, invalid data)
- **When** Errors occur at any point
- **Then** ERROR/WARNING logs include full context: URL, error messages, attempted fallbacks, correlation IDs
- **Verification**: Code review confirms structured logging throughout all error paths ✅

### Improvements Checklist

All requirements met by developer:

- [x] Department model with 7 data quality flags and validation helpers
- [x] Claude Agent SDK-based discovery with comprehensive error handling
- [x] Graceful degradation for all missing data scenarios (school, URL, metadata)
- [x] HTML structure validation with issue detection
- [x] Manual fallback configuration support with JSON validation
- [x] Structure gap report generation with user-friendly descriptions
- [x] Validation with 50% thresholds (blocks pipeline if <50% completeness)
- [x] Comprehensive structured logging at all error points with correlation IDs
- [x] 36 unit tests + 13 integration tests with complete error scenario coverage
- [x] All linting (ruff) and type checking (mypy) passing for Story 2.4 files
- [x] Type annotations improved during QA review (3 dict type parameters added)

**Minor Enhancement Opportunities (Non-blocking):**

- [ ] Consider converting `ValidationResult` to Pydantic model for consistency (low priority, low value)
- [ ] Add integration test with live HTTP requests to validate retry behavior against real endpoints (low priority, deferred to manual testing)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** ✅

- No security vulnerabilities identified
- Error handling prevents information leakage (generic error messages to user)
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Structured logger automatically masks sensitive fields (password, api_key, token, secret)
- Input validation via Pydantic models prevents injection attacks
- File operations use explicit UTF-8 encoding
- Manual fallback config properly validated with exception handling

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** ✅

- **SDK Error Handling**: Claude Agent SDK provides efficient built-in retry logic
- **Timeout Configuration**: 30-second timeout per page is appropriate for web scraping workloads
- **Async Operations**: Proper async/await enables concurrent processing without blocking
- **No Performance Bottlenecks**: Clean, efficient code with minimal overhead

**Optimization Opportunities** (future, non-critical):
- Batch validation results could be cached if method called multiple times (unlikely scenario)
- Gap report generation could be deferred until explicitly requested (minor optimization)

### Testability Evaluation

**Controllability**: ✅ EXCELLENT
- All external dependencies (SDK, file I/O) properly mocked in tests
- Test fixtures provide full control over input data and error scenarios
- Manual fallback paths allow complete control over discovery outcomes

**Observability**: ✅ EXCELLENT
- Structured logging with correlation IDs enables complete execution tracing
- Data quality flags provide fine-grained visibility into degradation decisions
- Gap reports and validation results expose internal state to users
- Test assertions validate all observable outputs (flags, logs, reports)

**Debuggability**: ✅ EXCELLENT
- Clear error messages with full context (URL, error type, attempted fallbacks)
- Correlation IDs enable multi-agent trace correlation
- Structured JSON logs support log aggregation and querying
- Comprehensive test coverage enables rapid regression debugging

### Technical Debt Identification

**No technical debt introduced** ✅

The implementation is clean, well-documented, and follows all architectural patterns. The Claude Agent SDK refactoring (Story 2.1) actually *reduced* technical debt by eliminating manual retry logic.

**Project-Level Debt (Outside Story 2.4 Scope):**
- 9 mypy type-arg errors in shared utilities (`logger.py`, `checkpoint_manager.py`, `llm_helpers.py`) - should be addressed in future stories
- 7 failing tests in `test_llm_helpers.py` (JSON parsing issues) - unrelated to Story 2.4, but should be fixed

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified by QA:**
- `src/agents/university_discovery.py` - Added 3 dict type parameter annotations (lines 106, 164, 1183)

**Recommendation**: Developer should update File List in Dev Agent Record section to include this QA modification.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → `docs/qa/gates/2.4-error-handling-structure.yml`

**Quality Score: 100/100**

**Summary:**
- 0 blocking issues (FAILs)
