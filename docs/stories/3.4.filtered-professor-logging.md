# Story 3.4: Filtered Professor Logging & Transparency

## Status

**Done**

## Dependencies

**Must Be Complete Before Starting:**
- **Story 3.2**: LLM-Based Professor Research Field Filtering (provides Professor model with `is_relevant`, `relevance_reasoning` fields - see Story 3.2:44-49 for field definitions)
- **Story 3.3**: Confidence Scoring for Filtering Decisions (provides `relevance_confidence` field and borderline-professors.md report)
- **Story 3.1**: Multi-Agent Professor Discovery (provides professor records)
- **Story 1.4**: Shared Utilities (provides `checkpoint_manager`, `logger`)

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** detailed logs of filtered-out professors with reasoning,
**so that** I can validate the system didn't miss relevant labs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All filtered professors logged with exclusion reasoning (FR13)
2. Log includes: professor name, department, research areas, confidence score, filter reason
3. Log saved to dedicated file (filtered-professors.md or similar)
4. Reasoning explains why research didn't align
5. User can review and manually add back professors if needed
6. Statistics provided: "Filtered X of Y professors (Z%)"

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Log All Filter Decisions to Structured Logger** (AC: 1, 2)

  - [x] Implement manual professor addition loading in module-level function `load_manual_additions()` in `src/agents/professor_filter.py`
  - [x] Support `config/manual-professor-additions.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "additions": [
        {
          "professor_id": "prof-456",

- [x] **Task 6: Add Search/Filter Functionality Guidance** (AC: 5)
  - [x] At end of report, provide instructions:
    ```markdown
    ## How to Override Filter Decisions

    If you believe a professor was incorrectly filtered:

    1. Create/edit `config/manual-professor-additions.json`
    2. Add professor ID to "additions" list
    3. Re-run the pipeline from Phase 3

    The professor will be included in subsequent analysis.
    ```

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Component:** Professor Filter Agent - Transparency Logging Module (Epic 3)

**Responsibility:** Provide transparent logging of all filter decisions (Epic 3: FR13)

**Architecture Pattern:** Module-level functions in `src/agents/professor_filter.py` (matching Story 3.2 pattern - NO class structure)

**Key Interfaces (Module-Level Functions):**
- `async def generate_filter_report(professors: list[Professor], output_dir: str, correlation_id: str) -> None` - Create filtered-professors.md report from filtered professor list
- `def log_filter_decision(professor: Professor, logger: BoundLogger) -> None` - Log single filter decision using professor.is_relevant, relevance_confidence, relevance_reasoning fields
- `async def load_manual_additions(config_path: str) -> dict` - Load manual professor additions from config/manual-professor-additions.json
- `async def apply_manual_additions(professors: list[Professor], additions: dict, correlation_id: str) -> list[Professor]` - Apply manual overrides to professor list

**Dependencies:**
- Structured Logger for decision logging (Story 1.4: `src/utils/logger.py`)
- Professor Filter Agent from Story 3.2 (provides `is_relevant`, `relevance_reasoning` fields - see Story 3.2:44-49)
- Confidence Scoring from Story 3.3 (provides `relevance_confidence` field and borderline-professors.md)
- Professor model with `data_quality_flags: list[str]` field (Story 3.1a)
- Checkpoint Manager for loading filtered professors (Story 1.4)
- File system for report generation

**Technology Stack:**
- structlog for structured logging
- Markdown generation for reports
- Python statistics for filter stats

**Source Tree Location:**
- **Modify:** `src/agents/professor_filter.py` (add reporting functions: `generate_filter_report()`, `log_filter_decision()`, `load_manual_additions()`, `apply_manual_additions()`)
- **Modify:** `src/models/professor.py` (add `"manual_addition"` to `PROFESSOR_DATA_QUALITY_FLAGS` constant)
- **Create:** `tests/unit/test_filter_logging.py` (reporting-specific tests)
- **Create:** `output/filtered-professors.md` (main transparency report)
- **Optional Create:** `config/manual-professor-additions.json` (user overrides - only created if user needs manual additions)

**Checkpoint Files:**
- **Input:** `checkpoints/phase-2-professors-filtered-batch-*.jsonl` (filtered professors from Story 3.2/3.3 - note: phase-2, NOT phase-3)
- **Output (if manual additions applied):** `checkpoints/phase-2-professors-with-manual-additions.jsonl` (professors with manual overrides)
- **Primary Output:** `output/filtered-professors.md` (reporting artifact, not checkpoint)

**Filtered Professors Report Structure:**
```markdown
# Filtered Professors Report

## Executive Summary
- **Total Professors Evaluated:** 150
- **Included for Analysis:** 85 (56.7%)
- **Excluded:** 65 (43.3%)
- **Low-Confidence Decisions:** 12 (see borderline-professors.md)

## Filtering Statistics by Department

| Department | Total | Included | Excluded | Inclusion Rate |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Computer Science | 25 | 20 | 5 | 80% |
| Bioengineering | 30 | 28 | 2 | 93% |
| Literature | 15 | 0 | 15 | 0% |

## Excluded Professors

### High Confidence Exclusions (≥90)
[Table with professors clearly unrelated]

### Medium Confidence Exclusions (70-89)
[Table with professors moderately unrelated]

### Low Confidence Exclusions (<70)
**⚠️ Review Recommended** - See borderline-professors.md

## Included Professors Summary

### High Confidence Inclusions (≥90)
[Top matching professors with clear alignment]

## How to Override Filter Decisions
[Instructions for manual additions]
```

**Logging Strategy:**
- **All decisions logged:** Both include and exclude
- **Structured JSON logs:** Machine-parseable for analysis
- **Human-readable report:** Markdown for user review
- **Cross-referenced:** Link to borderline cases report

**Statistics Calculation:**
```python
def calculate_filter_statistics(professors: list[Professor]) -> dict:
    """Calculate filtering statistics with edge case handling."""
    total = len(professors)

    # Edge case: no professors
    if total == 0:
        return {
            "total": 0,
            "included": {"count": 0, "percentage": 0.0, "high_confidence": 0, "medium_confidence": 0, "low_confidence": 0},
            "excluded": {"count": 0, "percentage": 0.0, "high_confidence": 0, "medium_confidence": 0, "low_confidence": 0}
        }

    included = [p for p in professors if p.is_relevant]
    excluded = [p for p in professors if not p.is_relevant]

    return {
        "total": total,
        "included": {
            "count": len(included),
            "percentage": len(included) / total * 100,
            "high_confidence": len([p for p in included if p.relevance_confidence >= 90]),
            "medium_confidence": len([p for p in included if 70 <= p.relevance_confidence < 90]),
            "low_confidence": len([p for p in included if p.relevance_confidence < 70])
        },
        "excluded": {
            "count": len(excluded),
            "percentage": len(excluded) / total * 100,
            "high_confidence": len([p for p in excluded if p.relevance_confidence >= 90]),
            "medium_confidence": len([p for p in excluded if 70 <= p.relevance_confidence < 90]),
            "low_confidence": len([p for p in excluded if p.relevance_confidence < 70])
        }
    }
```

**Critical Rules (from Coding Standards):**
- Never use print() for logging (use structlog)
- All filter decisions must be logged
- Reports must be human-readable markdown
- Statistics must be accurate and comprehensive

**Architecture Component Diagram Flow:**
```
CLI Coordinator → generate_filter_report() function
generate_filter_report() → Checkpoint Manager (load filtered professors)
generate_filter_report() → calculate_filter_statistics() (calculate stats)
generate_filter_report() → log_filter_decision() (for each professor via structured logger)
generate_filter_report() → File I/O (write filtered-professors.md)

CLI Coordinator → load_manual_additions() function (if config exists)
CLI Coordinator → apply_manual_additions() function
apply_manual_additions() → Checkpoint Manager (save with manual overrides)
```

**Integration Points:**
- **When:** Report generation executes AFTER Story 3.2 (filtering) AND Story 3.3 (confidence scoring) complete
- **Trigger:** CLI coordinator calls `generate_filter_report()` at end of Epic 3 processing
- **Manual Additions:** Optionally executed before report generation if `config/manual-professor-additions.json` exists
- **Execution Sequence:** Filter professors (3.2) → Score confidence (3.3) → Apply manual additions (3.4 optional) → Generate report (3.4)

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `tests/unit/test_filter_logging.py`

**Testing Standards:**
- Framework: pytest 7.4.4
- Test report generation with mock data
- Coverage requirement: 70% minimum

**Test Requirements:**
1. Test filter decision logging to structlog
2. Test filtered-professors.md report generation
3. Test filtering statistics calculation
4. Test manual professor addition loading
5. Test cross-referencing with borderline cases
6. Test report formatting (markdown validity)
7. Test edge cases (all included, all excluded, empty list)

**Example Test Pattern:**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_generate_filter_report(tmp_path):
    # Arrange
    professors = [
        Professor(
            id="1", name="Dr. Smith", title="Professor",
            department_id="cs-1", department_name="Computer Science",
            profile_url="https://example.edu/smith",
            research_areas=["AI", "ML"],
            is_relevant=True,
            relevance_confidence=95,
            relevance_reasoning="Strong match with user's AI interests"
        ),
        Professor(
            id="2", name="Dr. Doe", title="Professor",
            department_id="lit-1", department_name="Literature",
            profile_url="https://example.edu/doe",
            research_areas=["Poetry"],
            is_relevant=False,
            relevance_confidence=98,
            relevance_reasoning="No overlap with user's technical interests"
        ),
    ]

    # Import module-level function
    from src.agents.professor_filter import generate_filter_report

    # Act
    await generate_filter_report(professors, str(tmp_path), "test-corr-id")

    # Assert
    report_path = tmp_path / "filtered-professors.md"
    assert report_path.exists()
    content = report_path.read_text()
    assert "Dr. Smith" in content
    assert "Dr. Doe" in content
    assert "Included: 1 (50" in content  # Percentage formatting may vary
    assert "Excluded: 1 (50" in content
```

- [x] Created 17 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
- [x] Applied UTF-8 encoding for cross-platform compatibility
- [x] All tests passing, ruff passing, mypy passing

**Optional Future Enhancements (Non-Blocking):**
- [ ] Consider extracting report section generation into separate functions for easier testing/modification
- [ ] Add configuration option for number of professors shown in report tables (currently hardcoded 50/20/10)
- [ ] Consider adding report generation timestamp to filtered-professors.md header

### Security Review

✅ **PASS** - No security concerns identified:
- File path handling is safe (uses Path objects)
- No SQL injection vectors (no database access)
- No XSS risks (markdown output, not HTML)
- Input validation on professor IDs
- JSON parsing uses safe json.load() with error handling

### Performance Considerations

✅ **PASS** - Performance is appropriate for the use case:
- O(n) complexity for statistics calculation
- O(n) complexity for report generation
- Efficient list comprehensions used throughout
- File I/O properly async
- No unnecessary iterations

**Note:** In `generate_filter_report()` (line 1887-1888), all filter decisions are logged during report generation. If this function is called multiple times in a session, logs will be duplicated. This is acceptable for current usage (called once per pipeline run), but worth noting for future integration.

### Files Modified During Review

None - no modifications were necessary during review.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → docs/qa/gates/3.4-filtered-professor-logging.yml

**Quality Score: 95/100**

Calculation: 100 - 0 (no FAILs) - 0 (no CONCERNS) = 100, reduced to 95 for minor optimization opportunities

### Recommended Status

✅ **Ready for Done**

All acceptance criteria are fully met, tests are comprehensive and passing, code quality is excellent, and no blocking issues were identified. This story is production-ready.
