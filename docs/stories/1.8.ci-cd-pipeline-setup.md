# Story 1.8: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (Optional)

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Configuration Infrastructure

**Status:** Optional / Low Priority

---

## User Story

As a **developer**,
I want **a CI/CD pipeline configured for automated linting, type checking, and testing**,
so that **code quality is validated on every commit and pull request**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow file created (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
2. Workflow runs on push to main branch and on pull requests
3. Linting stage executes ruff with project configuration
4. Type checking stage executes mypy with project configuration
5. Unit test stage executes pytest with coverage reporting
6. Integration test stage executes pytest integration tests (with MCP server mocking)
7. Workflow fails if any stage fails (linting errors, type errors, test failures, coverage < 70%)
8. Badge added to README.md showing CI status
9. Workflow execution time kept under 10 minutes for fast feedback

---

## Technical Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Linting (ruff)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python 3.11.7
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11.7'
      - name: Install dependencies

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio pytest-mock
      - name: Run unit tests with coverage
        run: pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=term --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=70
      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov (optional)
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        if: success()
        with:
          file: ./coverage.xml
          fail_ci_if_error: false

  integration-tests:
    name: Integration Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python 3.11.7
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:

        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install MCP servers (mocked for CI)
        run: |
          # Note: Integration tests will mock MCP server responses
          # No actual MCP servers installed in CI environment
          echo "MCP servers will be mocked in integration tests"
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: pytest tests/integration/ -v
        env:
          CI: true  # Flag to enable MCP mocking in tests
```

### Badge for README.md

Add to top of README.md:

```markdown
# Lab Finder

[![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/<username>/lab-finder/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<username>/lab-finder/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
```

### Workflow Optimization Notes

1. **Parallel Execution:** All jobs (lint, type-check, unit-tests, integration-tests) run in parallel for speed
2. **Caching:** Consider adding pip cache to speed up dependency installation
3. **Conditional Execution:** Integration tests only run if unit tests pass (add `needs: unit-tests` if desired)
4. **MCP Server Mocking:** Integration tests detect `CI=true` environment variable and mock MCP responses instead of connecting to real servers

---

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create GitHub Actions directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Create CI workflow file:**
   - Copy YAML content above to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Adjust branch names if using different convention (e.g., `main` vs `master`)

3. **Update README.md:**
   - Add CI status badge at top
   - Replace `<username>` with actual GitHub username/org

4. **Configure MCP mocking for CI:**
   - Update integration tests to detect `CI` environment variable
   - Use mocked MCP responses when `os.getenv('CI') == 'true'`
   - Document in `tests/integration/README.md`

5. **Test workflow locally (optional):**
   - Install `act` (GitHub Actions local runner): https://github.com/nektos/act
   - Run: `act -j lint` to test linting stage locally

6. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/ci.yml README.md
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline with linting, type checking, and testing"
   git push origin main
   ```

7. **Verify workflow execution:**
   - Check GitHub Actions tab in repository
   - Ensure all jobs pass on first run
   - Fix any issues identified by CI

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 1.0 (Project Initialization) - requires git repository
- Story 1.1 (Project Setup) - requires requirements.txt
- Story 1.6 (Testing Infrastructure) - requires pytest configuration
- ruff.toml, mypy.ini, pytest.ini configured

**Depends On:**
- Story 1.0, 1.1, 1.6, 1.7

**Blocks:**
- None (optional enhancement)

---

## Testing

### Verification Steps

1. **Workflow file validation:**
   ```bash
   # Use GitHub Actions extension in VS Code, or
   # Validate YAML syntax
   yamllint .github/workflows/ci.yml
   ```

2. **Local execution test:**
   ```bash
   # Test linting stage locally
   ruff check .
   ruff format --check .

   # Test type checking locally
   mypy src/

   # Test unit tests locally
   pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-fail-under=70

   # Test integration tests locally
   CI=true pytest tests/integration/ -v
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions execution:**
   - Push to main or create pull request
   - Navigate to Actions tab: https://github.com/<username>/lab-finder/actions
   - Verify all jobs complete successfully

4. **Badge verification:**
   - View README.md on GitHub
   - Verify CI badge displays "passing" status

### Success Criteria

- All workflow jobs (lint, type-check, unit-tests, integration-tests) pass
- Workflow completes in under 10 minutes
- CI badge displays correctly in README.md
- Failed tests/linting cause workflow to fail (red X on commit)
- Passing tests show green checkmark on commit

## Notes

### Why This Story is Optional

1. **Local Development Sufficient:** Developers can run linting, type checking, and tests locally before committing
2. **Small Team/Solo Developer:** For personal projects or small teams, manual testing may be adequate
3. **Setup Overhead:** CI/CD adds configuration complexity for a one-off execution tool
4. **Cost:** GitHub Actions has limited free minutes (2000/month for free tier)

### When to Implement This Story

**Implement if:**
- Multiple developers contributing to the codebase
- Want automated quality gates before merging pull requests
- Planning to publish as open-source project (CI badge shows project health)
- Team wants fast feedback loop on code quality

**Skip if:**
- Solo developer project
- Comfortable running tests manually before commits
- Limited GitHub Actions minutes
- Want to focus on core functionality first (implement later)

### Alternative: Git Pre-commit Hooks

If CI/CD is too heavyweight, consider local git pre-commit hooks instead:

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
ruff check . || exit 1
mypy src/ || exit 1
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-fail-under=70 || exit 1
```

This provides local quality gates without requiring GitHub Actions.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

From **Infrastructure and Deployment** section:

**CI/CD Platform:** None (optional: GitHub Actions for tests only)

**Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/tests.yml` (if CI enabled)

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests: 70% coverage minimum
- Integration tests: Cover all external API integrations
- Pytest ecosystem (asyncio, cov, mock)

**Coding Standards Enforcement:**
- **Linting:** ruff 0.1.11 (replaces black, flake8, isort)
- **Type Checking:** mypy 1.8.0 (enforces type hints)
- **Test Coverage:** pytest-cov 4.1.0 (tracks coverage metrics)

### MCP Server Mocking in CI

Integration tests should detect CI environment and mock MCP servers:

```python
# tests/integration/conftest.py
import os
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def mcp_client():
    if os.getenv('CI') == 'true':
        # Use mocked MCP client in CI
        return MockMCPClient()
    else:
        # Use real MCP client locally
        return RealMCPClient()
```

This avoids requiring MCP servers to be installed and configured in CI environment.

### Performance Optimization

**Caching Dependencies:**

Add to workflow for faster runs:

```yaml
- name: Cache pip dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('requirements.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

**Parallel Job Execution:**

Current configuration runs all jobs in parallel (default behavior). To enforce sequential execution (e.g., only run integration tests if unit tests pass):

```yaml
integration-tests:
  needs: unit-tests  # Wait for unit tests to pass
```
