## Status

**Done**

## Dependencies

**Must Be Complete Before Starting:**
- **Story 3.2**: LLM-Based Professor Research Field Filtering (provides Professor model with `relevance_confidence`, `is_relevant`, `relevance_reasoning` fields)
- **Story 3.1a**: Professor Model + Basic Discovery (provides Professor model definition and professor records)
- **Story 3.1b**: Parallel Processing & Batch Coordination (provides batch processing infrastructure that Story 3.2 builds upon)
- **Story 1.4**: Shared Utilities (provides `llm_helpers`, `checkpoint_manager`, `logger`)

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** confidence scores provided for each filtering decision,
**so that** I can review borderline cases and understand the system's certainty.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Confidence score (0-100) generated for each professor filtering decision (FR12)
2. Score reflects LLM's certainty about research field alignment (FR12)
3. Low-confidence decisions (e.g., <70%) flagged for user review (FR12)
4. Confidence scores saved with professor records (FR12)
5. Thresholds configurable in system parameters (FR12)
6. Score rationale includes key matching factors (FR12)

  - [x] Modify existing `PROFESSOR_FILTER_PROMPT` template in `src/utils/llm_helpers.py` (created in Story 3.2)
  - [x] Update prompt to request detailed confidence explanation
  - [x] Prompt should ask LLM to explain confidence level:
    ```
    Provide confidence score (0-100) reflecting:
    - Strength of research overlap (strong/moderate/weak)

  - [x] Update `PROFESSOR_DATA_QUALITY_FLAGS` set in `src/models/professor.py`
  - [x] Add new flags:
    - `"low_confidence_filter"` - For confidence < threshold
    - `"llm_response_error"` - For malformed LLM responses
    - `"manual_override"` - For user manual overrides

- [x] **Task 4: Parse and Validate Confidence Scores** (AC: 1) *[Depends on Task 2]*
  - [x] Parse confidence from LLM JSON response
  - [x] Handle both int and float types:
    - If float: Convert to int via `int(round(confidence))`
    - If int: Use directly
    - If string: Attempt conversion to float then int
  - [x] Validate confidence is in range 0-100
  - [x] If confidence invalid or missing: Set to 50 (neutral) and flag with `"llm_response_error"`

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Component:** Professor Filter Agent - Confidence Scoring Module (Epic 3)

**Responsibility:** Provide confidence scores for filtering decisions; flag borderline cases (FR12)

**Key Interfaces:**
- `calculate_confidence_stats(professors: list[Professor]) -> dict` - Compute confidence distribution
- `identify_borderline_cases(professors: list[Professor], threshold: int) -> list[Professor]`

**Dependencies:**
- LLM Helpers for enhanced prompts with confidence (Story 1.4)
- Professor Filter Agent from Story 3.2
- System parameters config for thresholds
- Structured Logger for confidence-based logging

**Technology Stack:**
- Python statistics for distribution calculation
- JSON for confidence stats export
- Pydantic validation for confidence scores

**Source Tree Location:**
- Modify: `src/agents/professor_filter.py` (add confidence logic)
- Modify: `src/models/professor.py` (add new quality flags to PROFESSOR_DATA_QUALITY_FLAGS constant)
- Modify: `src/utils/llm_helpers.py` (enhance PROFESSOR_FILTER_PROMPT with confidence explanation)
- Modify: `config/system_params.json` (add filtering_config)
- Create: `output/borderline-professors.md` (review report)
- Create: `output/filter-confidence-stats.json` (statistics)
- Optional: `config/manual-overrides.json` (user overrides)

**Confidence Scoring Levels:**
- **High (90-100):** Strong, clear research overlap; multiple matching areas
- **Medium (70-89):** Moderate overlap; some matching areas or tangential connection
- **Low (<70):** Weak or unclear overlap; requires manual review

**Expected Confidence Distribution (typical):**
- High confidence (90-100): ~40-50% of decisions
- Medium confidence (70-89): ~30-40% of decisions
- Low confidence (<70): ~10-20% of decisions

*Note: Actual distribution will vary based on user profile specificity and department relevance. Use these as guidelines for validation.*

**Enhanced LLM Response Format:**
```json
{
  "decision": "include" | "exclude",
  "confidence": 85,
  "reasoning": "Strong overlap in machine learning and neural networks",
  "key_factors": [
    "Direct match: Machine Learning",
    "Direct match: Neural Networks",
    "Moderate match: Data Science (related to user's AI interests)"
  ],
  "confidence_explanation": "High confidence due to multiple direct matches in core research areas"
}
```

**Edge Case Handling:**
- **Confidence is float (e.g., 85.0, 85.5):** Convert to int via `int(round(confidence))` - LLM may return floats
- **Confidence > 100 or < 0:** Clamp to valid range (0-100), log at ERROR level, add `"confidence_out_of_range"` flag
  ```python
  if confidence < 0:
      logger.error("Negative confidence returned", confidence=confidence, professor=prof.name)
      confidence = 0
      professor.data_quality_flags.append("confidence_out_of_range")
  elif confidence > 100:
      logger.error("Confidence exceeds 100", confidence=confidence, professor=prof.name)
      confidence = 100
      professor.data_quality_flags.append("confidence_out_of_range")
  ```
- **Non-numeric confidence:** Set to 50 (neutral), log WARNING, add `"llm_response_error"` flag
- **Missing confidence field:** Set to 50 (neutral), log WARNING, add `"llm_response_error"` flag
- **Malformed JSON response:** Log error at ERROR level, set confidence to 50, flag as `"llm_response_error"`
- **Confidence present but invalid type (string, null, etc.):** Attempt conversion (string→float→int); if fails, set to 50, log WARNING, add `"llm_response_error"` flag

*Edge cases with clamping (out-of-range) logged at ERROR level to surface potential prompt issues. Other edge cases logged at WARNING level with professor identifier for debugging.*

**Confidence Threshold Logic:**
```python
# From system_params.json
LOW_THRESHOLD = 70
HIGH_THRESHOLD = 90

if confidence >= HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    status = "high_confidence"
elif confidence >= LOW_THRESHOLD:
    status = "medium_confidence"
else:
    status = "low_confidence"
    # Flag for review
    professor.data_quality_flags.append("low_confidence_filter")
```

**Borderline Cases Report Format:**
```markdown
# Borderline Professor Filtering Cases

**Low Confidence Threshold:** 70
**Total Borderline Cases:** 12 (8.0% of total professors)
**Breakdown:** 5 included (low confidence), 7 excluded (low confidence)

---

## Included Professors (Low Confidence) - 5 cases

These professors were **included** despite low confidence. Consider if they should be excluded.

| Professor | Department | Research Areas | Confidence | Reasoning | Profile Link | Recommend Override? |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| [Dr. Jane Smith](https://example.edu/faculty/jsmith) | Computer Science | HCI, Visualization | 65 | Tangential overlap with user's AI interests | [View Profile](https://example.edu/faculty/jsmith) | Review - tangential match |

## Excluded Professors (Low Confidence) - 7 cases

These professors were **excluded** due to low confidence. Consider if they should be included.

| Professor | Department | Research Areas | Confidence | Reasoning | Profile Link | Recommend Override? |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| [Dr. John Doe](https://example.edu/faculty/jdoe) | Statistics | Bayesian Methods | 68 | Weak connection to user's deep learning focus | [View Profile](https://example.edu/faculty/jdoe) | Consider - emerging field |

---

**Action Required:** Review these borderline cases manually. To override decisions, add entries to `config/manual-overrides.json`:

\```json
{
  "professor_overrides": [
    {
      "professor_id": "prof-id-here",
      "decision": "include" | "exclude",
      "reason": "Your reasoning here",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-07T14:30:00Z",
      "original_confidence": 65,
      "original_decision": "include"
    }
  ]
}
\```
```

**Critical Rules (from Coding Standards):**
- Confidence scores must be validated (0-100 range)
- Always flag low-confidence decisions for user review
- Never use print() for logging (use structlog)
- All confidence thresholds must be configurable

**Architecture Component Diagram Flow:**
```
Professor Filter Agent → LLM (request confidence + reasoning)
Professor Filter Agent → Confidence Validator (validate score)
Professor Filter Agent → Threshold Checker (identify borderline)
Professor Filter Agent → Report Generator (borderline-professors.md)
Professor Filter Agent → Stats Calculator (filter-confidence-stats.json)
```

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `tests/unit/test_confidence_scoring.py`

**Testing Standards:**
- Framework: pytest 7.4.4
- Mock LLM responses with various confidence levels
- Coverage requirement: 70% minimum
- Priority coverage: Confidence parsing, threshold checking, borderline identification, stats calculation, edge case handling

**Test Requirements:**
1. Test confidence score parsing from LLM response
2. Test confidence validation (valid and invalid scores)
3. Test low-confidence identification
4. Test confidence statistics calculation
5. Test borderline cases report generation
6. Test manual override application
7. Test threshold configuration loading

**Example Test Pattern:**
```python
def test_identify_low_confidence_cases():
    # Arrange
    professors = [
        Professor(id="1", name="Dr. Smith", relevance_confidence=95, is_relevant=True),
        Professor(id="2", name="Dr. Doe", relevance_confidence=65, is_relevant=True),
        Professor(id="3", name="Dr. Lee", relevance_confidence=45, is_relevant=False),
    ]
    threshold = 70
    agent = ProfessorFilterAgent()

    # Act
    borderline = agent.identify_borderline_cases(professors, threshold)

    # Assert
    assert len(borderline) == 2  # Doe and Lee below threshold
    assert all(p.relevance_confidence < threshold for p in borderline)
    assert "low_confidence_filter" in professors[1].data_quality_flags
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: EXCELLENT (95/100)**

Story 3.3 demonstrates exceptional implementation quality with comprehensive testing, robust error handling, and excellent architectural decisions. The confidence scoring system is production-ready with thoughtful edge case handling and user-centric reporting.

**Strengths:**
- **Exceptional test coverage**: 32 tests covering all 9 tasks with 100% AC traceability
- **Robust validation logic**: `validate_confidence_score()` handles 7+ edge cases (floats, strings, booleans, negatives, out-of-range, null, malformed)
- **Production-grade error handling**: Graceful degradation with neutral defaults (confidence=50) and comprehensive data quality flagging
- **User-centric design**: Borderline report includes actionable recommendations with keyword-based override suggestions
- **Configuration validation**: Pydantic validator ensures threshold ordering (0 < low < high <= 100) at config load time
- **Quality assessment automation**: Distribution analysis warns when >30% low-confidence (suggests prompt issues)
- **Audit trail**: Manual overrides include timestamp, original confidence, original decision for transparency
- **Enhanced LLM prompt**: Requests key_factors and confidence_explanation for better interpretability

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Clean separation of concerns: validation → identification → reporting → statistics → overrides
- Type-safe implementation with proper ValidationInfo usage from Pydantic
- Proper mocking in tests to avoid external dependencies
- Comprehensive logging at appropriate levels (WARNING for low-confidence, ERROR for clamping)

- **Coverage:** ✓ COMPLETE - Both fields documented in prompt line 149

**Traceability Score: 100% (6/6 ACs fully implemented and tested)**

### Security Review

**Status: ✓ PASS - No security concerns**

- Configuration validation prevents injection attacks via threshold manipulation
- Manual override file parsing includes JSON validation with graceful failure
- No credentials or sensitive data in confidence scoring logic
- Logging properly sanitizes raw LLM responses (truncates to 50 chars)

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ✓ PASS - Efficient implementation**

- Confidence validation is O(1) with no expensive operations
- Statistics calculation is O(n) single pass over professors list
- Borderline report generation only triggers when threshold violations exist
- Manual override lookup uses O(1) dict lookup by professor ID
- No performance bottlenecks identified

**Optimization notes:**
- Borderline report skips file generation when no borderline cases (smart!)
- Stats calculation includes early warnings for distribution anomalies

### Technical Debt Assessment

**Status: ✓ EXCELLENT - Minimal debt**

**Minor style issues (non-blocking):**
- 18 line-length warnings (E501) in professor_filter.py - Long f-strings for report generation
- 1 complexity warning (C901) - Existing from Story 3.1a, not introduced here

**Recommendation:** Address line-length warnings in future refactoring sprint by extracting report generation to template-based approach. Not urgent - functional quality is excellent.

### Files Modified During Review

None - No refactoring required. Implementation is production-ready.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → docs/qa/gates/3.3-confidence-scoring.yml

**Quality Score: 95/100**
- Deductions: -5 for minor linting warnings (18 line-length violations)

**Risk Assessment:** LOW
- All tests passing ✓
- Comprehensive edge case handling ✓
- Production-grade error handling ✓
- No security concerns ✓
- No performance bottlenecks ✓

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done**
