# Story 7.3: Collaboration Network Identification

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** lab collaborations with other groups identified,
**so that** I understand the lab's research network and partnerships.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Frequent co-authors from other institutions identified (FR18)
2. Collaboration patterns analyzed from publications and acknowledgments
3. External collaborators distinguished from internal lab members
4. Major collaborations highlighted (repeated over multiple papers)
5. Collaborative institutions identified
6. Collaboration diversity assessed (single partner vs. many partners)
7. Results included in lab intelligence reports

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Extract External Co-Authors** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Get all co-authors from publications
  - [ ] Filter out lab members and same university
  - [ ] Identify external collaborators

- [ ] **Task 2: Analyze Collaboration Frequency** (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Count co-authorship frequency per collaborator
  - [ ] Identify major collaborations (>= 2 papers)

- [ ] **Task 3: Identify Collaborative Institutions** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Extract institution affiliations from papers
  - [ ] List collaborating universities/orgs

- [ ] **Task 4: Update Lab Model** (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Add fields:
    ```python
    collaborators: list[str] = []
    collaborative_institutions: list[str] = []
    ```
