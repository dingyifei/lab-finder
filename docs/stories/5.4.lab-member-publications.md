# Story 5.4: Lab Member Publication Discovery

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** publications by lab members (not just PI) identified,
**so that** I understand the full research output of the lab.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Lab members identified from Epic 4 website scraping (FR16)
2. Publications retrieved for each lab member (last 3 years)
3. Co-authorship patterns analyzed (PI + members)
4. Member publication metrics aggregated to lab level
5. Handles missing member lists gracefully (will be addressed in 5.5)
6. Progress shows "Processing member X of Y for Lab Z"
