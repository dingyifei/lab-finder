# Story 7.2: Core vs. Collaborator Assessment

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** labs assessed as core research drivers vs. collaborative contributors,
**so that** I can prioritize labs leading research in my area of interest.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Publication authorship patterns analyzed (FR24)
2. Core research indicators: First/last author majority, PI as corresponding author
3. Collaborator indicators: Consistent middle authorship, acknowledgment-only mentions
4. LLM synthesizes patterns into core vs. collaborator assessment
5. Assessment considers field norms (some fields emphasize different author positions)
6. Confidence score provided for assessment
7. Results included in fitness scoring

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Identify Core Research Indicators** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Check if PI is first/last author majority
  - [ ] Check corresponding author status

- [ ] **Task 2: Identify Collaborator Indicators** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Check if PI is middle author majority
  - [ ] Check acknowledgment-only papers

- [ ] **Task 3: LLM-Based Assessment** (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Prompt LLM with authorship patterns
  - [ ] Request core vs collaborator classification
  - [ ] Include field norms in prompt

- [ ] **Task 4: Update Lab Model** (AC: 1, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Add fields:
    ```python
    research_role: str = "unknown"  # core/collaborator/mixed
    research_role_confidence: int = 0
    ```
