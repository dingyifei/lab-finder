# Story 7.1: Authorship Pattern Analysis

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** authorship positions analyzed across publications,
**so that** I can distinguish between labs driving research vs. contributing as collaborators.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Author order extracted from each publication (FR23)
2. First author publications identified
3. Nth author (middle/last) publications identified
4. Authorship patterns aggregated by lab
5. Metrics calculated: % first author, % last author (often PI), % middle author
6. Patterns analyzed for PI and lab members separately
7. Results saved for fitness scoring

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Extract Author Positions** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] For each publication, get author list
  - [ ] Identify professor position in author list
  - [ ] Classify: first, last, middle

- [ ] **Task 2: Aggregate by Lab** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Group publications by lab
  - [ ] Calculate authorship metrics per lab

- [ ] **Task 3: Calculate Authorship Metrics** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] % first author publications
  - [ ] % last author (often PI)
  - [ ] % middle author

- [ ] **Task 4: Create Authorship Analysis Model** (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Create `src/models/authorship_analysis.py`
  - [ ] Fields:
    ```python
    class AuthorshipAnalysis(BaseModel):
        lab_id: str
        first_author_pct: float
        last_author_pct: float
        middle_author_pct: float
    ```
