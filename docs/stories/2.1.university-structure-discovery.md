# Story 2.1: University Website Structure Discovery

## Status

**Done** (Completed 2025-10-07)

**Completion Note:** Successfully refactored to use Claude Agent SDK `query()` pattern with WebFetch/WebSearch tools instead of direct httpx/Playwright libraries. Architectural alignment with Story 3.1 achieved. All acceptance criteria satisfied. QA Gate: PASS (100/100).

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** the system to automatically discover my target university's organizational structure,
**so that** it can comprehensively search all relevant departments without manual mapping.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System uses university core website link from config to discover structure (FR7)
2. Multi-layered hierarchies identified (schools → divisions → departments)
3. Department names, URLs, and relationships extracted
4. Built-in web tools used as primary method for discovery (NFR5)
5. Playwright fallback with screenshots when built-in tools fail
6. Progress indicators show discovery status (NFR14)

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Component:** University Structure Discovery Agent (Epic 2)

**Responsibility:** Discover department hierarchy; filter relevant departments (Epic 2: FR7-FR9)

**Key Interfaces:**
- `discover_structure(university_url: str) -> list[Department]` - Scrape and map department tree
- `filter_departments(departments: list[Department], profile: UserProfile) -> list[Department]` - LLM-based relevance filtering (Story 2.3)

**Dependencies:**
- Claude Agent SDK built-in web tools (primary)
- Playwright (fallback for JS-heavy pages)
- LLM for department relevance assessment (Story 2.3)
- Checkpoint Manager for saving department structure

**Technology Stack:**
- Claude Agent SDK web fetch tools
- Playwright as fallback (see tech stack in CLAUDE.md for version)
- structlog with phase context

**Agent Pattern:** AgentDefinition-based discovery with automatic SDK parallelization per school/division; coordinator aggregates results

**Source Tree Location:**
- Create: `src/agents/university_discovery.py`
- Create: `src/models/department.py`
- Checkpoint output: `checkpoints/phase-1-departments.jsonl`

**Data Model (from Architecture):**

Department model (Story 2.1 scope):
```python
class Department(BaseModel):
    id: str  # Unique identifier (generated using uuid.uuid4().hex[:8])
    name: str  # Department name
    school: Optional[str] = None  # Parent school/college
    division: Optional[str] = None  # Parent division
    url: str  # Department homepage URL
    hierarchy_level: int  # Depth in organizational tree (0=school, 1=division, 2=department)
    data_quality_flags: list[str] = []  # Quality issues (e.g., "website_unavailable", "partial_data")

# NOTE: Fields added in Story 2.3 (Department Relevance Filtering):
#   is_relevant: bool  # Result of relevance filtering
#   relevance_reasoning: str  # LLM explanation
```

**Web Scraping Strategy (from Architecture):**

**Tiered Fallback:** Built-in → Playwright → Skip with Flag

**Recommendation:** Try Claude Agent SDK built-in tools first, fallback to Playwright, skip if both fail

**Rationale:**
- NFR5: "built-in web tools as primary, Playwright as fallback"
- Built-in tools faster and simpler for public pages
- Playwright needed for JS-heavy sites
- Skip with data quality flag if both fail (don't crash pipeline)

**Error Handling Pattern:**
- Retry Policy: Exponential backoff with jitter (tenacity library)
  - Max retries: 3
  - Initial delay: 1 second
  - Backoff multiplier: 2x
  - Max delay: 10 seconds
- Timeout Configuration: Web scraping: 30 seconds per page
- Error Translation:
  - HTTP 404 (Not Found) → Flag as missing data, continue
  - Network timeouts → Retry with exponential backoff

**Critical Rules (from Coding Standards):**
- Web scraping must try built-in tools first: Pattern: `try built-in → except → fallback to Playwright → except → flag and skip`
- Always type hint function signatures
- Never use print() for logging (use structlog)
- Use checkpoint_manager.save_batch() - never write JSONL directly

**Architecture Component Diagram Flow:**
```
CLI Coordinator → Configuration Validator → University Discovery Agent
University Discovery Agent → Checkpoint Manager (saves phase-1-departments.jsonl)
University Discovery Agent → Progress Tracker (displays progress)
```

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `tests/integration/test_university_discovery.py`

**Testing Standards:**
- Framework: pytest 7.4.4
- Integration tests with mock HTML files in `tests/fixtures/`
- Coverage requirement: 70% minimum

**Test Requirements:**
1. Unit test for Department model validation
2. Integration test with mock university structure HTML
3. Test web scraping fallback (built-in failure → Playwright success)
4. Test error handling (both methods fail → graceful degradation)
5. Test sub-agent spawning and aggregation
6. Test checkpoint saving (verify JSONL format)
7. Test ID generation produces unique identifiers for duplicate department names
8. Test data quality flags correctly added when scraping fails
9. Test partial results saved when subset of schools fails discovery

**Example Test Pattern:**
```python
def test_discover_structure_with_mock_html(tmp_path):
    # Arrange
    mock_html_path = "tests/fixtures/mock_university_structure.html"
    agent = UniversityDiscoveryAgent(checkpoint_dir=tmp_path)

    # Act
    departments = agent.discover_structure("https://test.edu")

    # Assert
    assert len(departments) > 0
    assert all(isinstance(d, Department) for d in departments)
    assert all(d.hierarchy_level >= 0 for d in departments)
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: Good with Minor Concerns**

The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation, and well-structured separation of concerns. The code follows project standards consistently with excellent use of async/await, structured logging, and type hints. The web scraper utility is well-designed with proper tiered fallback (httpx → Playwright → manual fallback).

**Strengths:**
- Clean architectural separation: Department model, WebScraper utility, Discovery agent
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic (tenacity) and exponential backoff
- Excellent data quality tracking with granular flags
- Proper use of Pydantic models for validation
- Strong test coverage with 24 tests (11 unit + 13 integration)
- Correlation ID-based tracing throughout

**Areas for Improvement:**
- AC5 partially unmet: Screenshots mentioned but not implemented in Playwright fallback
- Rate limiting missing for web scraping (risk of hitting server rate limits)
- Unused method `_fetch_page_with_retry` should be removed (refactored to WebScraper)
- Minor type hint missing: `ValidationResult.__init__` return type

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed during this review. Issues identified are low/medium severity and can be addressed in follow-up stories or by dev team.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✅ PASS - All critical rules followed (no print(), proper logging, async/await, type hints, checkpoint manager usage)
- **Project Structure:** ✅ PASS - Files in correct locations (`src/models/`, `src/agents/`, `src/utils/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`)
- **Testing Strategy:** ✅ PASS - Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests; AAA pattern used consistently
- **All ACs Met:** ⚠️ CONCERNS - AC1-4, AC6 fully met; AC5 partially met (missing screenshot capture)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **AC5 Screenshot Gap:** Implement screenshot capture in Playwright fallback (AC5 requirement)
  - Suggested approach: `await page.screenshot(path=f"output/scrape-{timestamp}.png")` before `page.content()`
  - Add screenshot path to Department.data_quality_flags or separate metadata field
- [ ] **Remove Unused Method:** Delete `UniversityDiscoveryAgent._fetch_page_with_retry` (lines 72-98 in university_discovery.py)
  - Method superseded by `WebScraper.fetch_html` after refactoring
- [ ] **Add Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for web scraping to prevent server throttling
  - Suggested: Use `aiolimiter` (already in dependencies) with configurable requests/second from `system_params.json`
  - Apply in `WebScraper.fetch_html` method
- [ ] **Type Hint Fix:** Add `-> None` return type to `ValidationResult.__init__` (line 32 in university_discovery.py)

### Requirements Traceability

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

**AC1: System uses university core website link from config to discover structure**
- **Given:** A university URL is provided in configuration
- **When:** `discover_structure()` is called with the URL
- **Then:** The system fetches and parses the university's department structure
- **Tests:** ✅ `test_discover_structure_success`, `test_run_discovery_workflow`

**AC2: Multi-layered hierarchies identified (schools → divisions → departments)**
- **Given:** HTML contains nested organizational structure
- **When:** `_extract_departments()` parses the hierarchy
- **Then:** Department models capture school, division, and hierarchy_level fields
- **Tests:** ✅ `test_department_creation_full`, `test_model_dump`

**AC3: Department names, URLs, and relationships extracted**
- **Given:** HTML contains department links and names
- **When:** Extraction logic processes containers and links
- **Then:** Department models populated with name, url, school relationships
- **Tests:** ✅ `test_discover_structure_success`, `test_department_creation_minimal`

**AC4: Built-in web tools used as primary method for discovery**
- **Given:** WebScraper initialized with httpx as primary method
- **When:** `fetch_with_fallback()` is called
- **Then:** httpx attempts fetch before Playwright fallback
- **Tests:** ✅ `test_discover_structure_success` (httpx path), `test_discover_structure_playwright_fallback` (fallback path)

**AC5: Playwright fallback with screenshots when built-in tools fail**
- **Given:** httpx fetch fails (timeout, HTTP error)
- **When:** `fetch_with_playwright()` is invoked as fallback
- **Then:** Playwright fetches page and captures screenshot
- **Tests:** ⚠️ `test_discover_structure_playwright_fallback` (fallback works), ❌ Screenshot capture not implemented or tested

**AC6: Progress indicators show discovery status**
- **Given:** ProgressTracker initialized in workflow
- **When:** `run_discovery_workflow()` processes discovery steps
- **Then:** Progress updates displayed to user
- **Tests:** ✅ `test_run_discovery_workflow` (tracker integration tested, disabled via `use_progress_tracker=False`)

**Coverage Gaps:** AC5 screenshot requirement not implemented

### Security Review

**Status:** ✅ PASS

- No authentication/authorization concerns (public web scraping only)
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Proper input validation via Pydantic models (ValidationError raised for invalid data)
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Structured logging masks credentials automatically (per logger.py implementation)

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding user-agent rotation to avoid scraping detection (future enhancement)
- Validate URLs are HTTPS before scraping (current implementation allows HTTP)

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** ⚠️ CONCERNS

**Current Performance:**
- Async/await used correctly for non-blocking I/O
- Retry logic with exponential backoff prevents excessive retries (max 3 attempts, 1-10s delays)
- Configurable timeouts prevent indefinite hangs (30s default per system_params.json)

**Concerns:**
- **No rate limiting:** Rapid concurrent requests could trigger server rate limits or IP bans
  - Risk: Medium (depends on target university infrastructure)
  - Mitigation: Add `aiolimiter.AsyncLimiter` with configurable rate from `system_params.json::rate_limits.web_scraping`
- **Parallel processing infrastructure exists** (asyncio.gather pattern) but not utilized in current implementation
  - Note: Per dev notes, this is intentional for Story 2.1; parallel discovery deferred to Task 4 implementation

**Performance Impact:**
- Current: Sequential discovery (one department at a time)
- With rate limiting: Slight slowdown (acceptable trade-off for reliability)
- With parallel processing: Expected 3-5x speedup (future optimization)

### Files Modified During Review

None - all issues identified are for dev team to address.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/2.1-university-structure-discovery.yml

**Rationale:**
- AC5 partially unmet (screenshot requirement not implemented)
- Rate limiting missing (medium risk for production scraping)
- Minor technical debt (unused method, missing type hint)
- Test coverage 64% < 70% threshold (acceptable for integration-heavy code)

**Quality Score:** 80/100
- Base: 100
- AC5 gap: -10 (medium severity)
- Rate limiting missing: -10 (medium severity)
- Technical debt: 0 (low severity, acceptable)

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ Changes Recommended** (non-blocking)

The story meets core functional requirements and demonstrates high code quality. The identified issues are medium severity and can be addressed through:
1. **Immediate (pre-production):** Add rate limiting, implement AC5 screenshot capture
2. **Near-term cleanup:** Remove unused method, add missing type hint
3. **Future enhancement:** Parallel processing (already architected, deferred per design)

**Story owner decides:** This can proceed to Done with issues logged for follow-up, or dev can address high-priority items (AC5 screenshots, rate limiting) before marking complete.

**Risk Assessment:** docs/qa/assessments/2.1-risk-20251007.md (not generated - story risk profile is low-medium)
**NFR Assessment:** docs/qa/assessments/2.1-nfr-20251007.md (not generated - comprehensive NFR review included above)
