# Story 2.5: Batch Configuration for Department Processing

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** department processing configured to run in reasonable batches,
**so that** the system doesn't overwhelm resources with parallel operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Configurable batch size for parallel department processing (NFR4)
2. Default batch size set to reasonable value (e.g., 5 departments at a time)
3. Batch size configurable in system parameters JSON
4. Progress tracking shows current batch and remaining batches
5. Checkpointing between batches for resumability (NFR12)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Add Batch Configuration to System Parameters** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Update `config/system_params.json` schema to include batch settings
  - [x] Add fields:
    ```json
    {
      "batch_config": {
        "department_discovery_batch_size": 5,
        "professor_discovery_batch_size": 10,
        "publication_retrieval_batch_size": 20,
        "linkedin_matching_batch_size": 15
      }
    }
    ```

  - [x] Handle edge case: departments < batch_size (single batch)

- [x] **Task 3: Process Batches with Parallel Async Tasks** (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Integrate progress tracking from Task 6 during batch processing implementation
  - [x] For each batch of departments:
    - Create async tasks for parallel department processing using asyncio.gather()
    - Wait for all async tasks in batch to complete
    - Aggregate results from batch
    - Save checkpoint before moving to next batch
  - [x] Limit parallelism to batch size using Semaphore (not all departments at once)
  - [x] Use Python asyncio.gather() pattern from Story 3.1 v0.5
  - [x] Log: "Processing batch X of Y (departments A-B)"

- [x] **Task 4: Implement Batch-Level Checkpointing** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Use checkpoint_manager from Story 1.4

    - `checkpoints/phase-1-departments-batch-1.jsonl`
    - `checkpoints/phase-1-departments-batch-2.jsonl`
    - etc.
  - [x] Use `checkpoint_manager.save_batch(phase="phase-1", batch_id=X, data=batch_results)`
  - [x] Enable resumability: Skip already-completed batches on restart
  - [x] Use `checkpoint_manager.get_resume_point(phase="phase-1")` to identify restart batch

- [x] **Task 5: Implement Resume from Checkpoint** (AC: 5)
  - [x] On startup, check for existing checkpoints
  - [x] Use `checkpoint_manager.get_resume_point("phase-1")` to get first incomplete batch

  - [x] Start processing from resume_point batch
  - [x] Log: "Resuming from batch X (batches 1-Y already complete)"
  - [x] If all batches complete: Skip to next epic

- [x] **Task 6: Integrate Progress Tracking for Batches** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Use progress_tracker from Story 1.4
  - [x] Display two-level progress:
    - Overall: "Phase 1: University Discovery [batch X/Y]"
    - Batch: "Batch X: Processing departments 1-5 of 25"
  - [x] Update progress after each batch completion
  - [x] Show ETA based on batch completion rate
  - [x] Final summary: "Phase 1 complete: X departments discovered in Y batches"

    - Resource-constrained: batch_size = 2
  - [x] Warn about rate limiting if batch size too large

- [x] **Task 8: Test Batch Processing with Different Sizes** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Test with batch_size = 1 (sequential processing)
  - [x] Test with batch_size = 5 (default)
  - [x] Test with batch_size = 20 (high parallelism)
  - [x] Verify checkpoint creation for each batch
  - [x] Verify resume works correctly
  - [x] Monitor resource usage (memory, CPU) at different batch sizes

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Component:** CLI Coordinator + University Discovery Agent (Epic 2)

**Responsibility:** Batch-level coordination and checkpointing for department processing (NFR4, NFR12)

**Key Interfaces:**
- `divide_into_batches(items: list, batch_size: int) -> list[list]`
- `process_department_batch(batch: list[Department], batch_id: int) -> list[Department]`

**Dependencies:**
- Checkpoint Manager for batch-level checkpointing (Story 1.4)
- Progress Tracker for batch progress display (Story 1.4)
- System parameters config for batch size settings
- Python asyncio for parallel async execution

**Technology Stack:**
- Python math.ceil for batch calculation
- Python asyncio.gather() for parallel execution
- Checkpoint Manager JSONL batching

**Source Tree Location:**
- Modify: `src/coordinator.py` (add batch processing logic)
- Modify: `src/agents/university_discovery.py` (integrate with batching)
- Modify: `config/system_params.json` (add batch_config section)
- Create: `checkpoints/phase-1-departments-batch-*.jsonl` (batch checkpoints)

**Batch Processing Pattern (from Architecture):**

**NFR4 Context:** "Execute professor filtering (FR11) and subsequent lab research/analysis steps (FR14-FR24) in configurable batch sizes to limit concurrent parallel agents and Playwright instances"

**Batch Configuration Structure:**
```json
{
  "batch_config": {
    "department_discovery_batch_size": 5,
    "professor_discovery_batch_size": 10,
    "lab_research_batch_size": 8,
    "publication_retrieval_batch_size": 20,
    "linkedin_matching_batch_size": 15
  },
  "resource_limits": {
    "max_parallel_agents": 20,
    "max_playwright_instances": 5
  }
}
```

**Batch Processing Flow:**
```
1. Load departments from checkpoint/discovery
2. Divide into batches (batch_size from config)
3. For each batch:
   a. Create async tasks for departments in batch (parallel within batch using asyncio.gather())
   b. Wait for all async tasks to complete
   c. Aggregate batch results
   d. Save checkpoint: phase-1-departments-batch-{N}.jsonl
   e. Update progress tracker
4. Mark phase complete when all batches done
```

**Resumability Pattern:**
```python
# Pseudocode
resume_batch = checkpoint_manager.get_resume_point("phase-1")
if resume_batch > 0:
    # Load already completed batches
    completed = checkpoint_manager.load_batches("phase-1")
    logger.info(f"Resuming from batch {resume_batch}")

# Process remaining batches
for batch_id in range(resume_batch, total_batches):
    batch_data = batches[batch_id]
    results = process_batch(batch_data)
    checkpoint_manager.save_batch("phase-1", batch_id, results)
```

**Critical Rules (from Coding Standards):**
- Use checkpoint_manager.save_batch() - never write JSONL directly
- Always type hint function signatures
- Never use print() for logging (use structlog)
- Batch sizes must be configurable, never hardcoded

**Architecture Component Diagram Flow:**
```
CLI Coordinator → Configuration Validator (load batch_config)
  ↓
CLI Coordinator → Batch Divider (divide departments into batches)
  ↓
For each batch:
  CLI Coordinator → University Discovery Agent (process batch with asyncio.gather())
  University Discovery Agent → Parallel async tasks (asyncio.gather() with Semaphore)
  CLI Coordinator → Checkpoint Manager (save batch results)
  CLI Coordinator → Progress Tracker (update progress)
```

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `tests/integration/test_batch_processing.py`

**Testing Standards:**
- Framework: pytest 7.4.4
- Integration tests with temporary checkpoint directories
- Coverage requirement: 70% minimum

**Test Requirements:**
1. Unit test for divide_into_batches function
2. Test batch processing with different batch sizes
3. Test checkpoint creation for each batch
4. Test resume from checkpoint (partial completion)
5. Test progress tracking for batch processing
6. Integration test with mock department data

**Example Test Pattern:**
```python
def test_batch_processing_with_resume(tmp_path):
    # Arrange
    departments = [Department(id=str(i), name=f"Dept{i}",
                              url=f"https://dept{i}.edu", hierarchy_level=0)
                   for i in range(15)]
    batch_size = 5
    coordinator = CLICoordinator(checkpoint_dir=tmp_path, batch_size=batch_size)

    # Simulate partial completion (first 2 batches done)
    checkpoint_manager.save_batch("phase-1", 0, departments[0:5])
    checkpoint_manager.save_batch("phase-1", 1, departments[5:10])

    # Act
    resume_batch = checkpoint_manager.get_resume_point("phase-1")
    coordinator.process_departments_in_batches(departments, start_batch=resume_batch)

    # Assert
    assert resume_batch == 2  # Should resume from batch 2
    batch_2_file = tmp_path / "checkpoints" / "phase-1-departments-batch-2.jsonl"
    assert batch_2_file.exists()
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall: EXCELLENT** ⭐

This is a well-crafted implementation demonstrating professional software engineering practices:

- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with CLICoordinator orchestrating batch processing, checkpoint management, and progress tracking
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive docstrings, consistent type hints, proper error handling, and clear intent throughout
- **Test Coverage**: 17 unit tests (100% pass rate) with excellent edge case coverage including empty lists, single batches, exact division, and resume functionality

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `src/coordinator.py`
- **Change**: Moved `import uuid` from line 92 (inside `__init__`) to module level (line 11)
- **Why**: Module-level imports are Python best practice per PEP 8; improves performance by importing once vs. every instantiation
- **How**: Relocated import statement to top of file with other imports, maintaining sorted order

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS
  - Uses structlog consistently (no print() statements)
  - All functions have type hints
  - Pydantic models for configuration validation
  - Uses checkpoint_manager.save_batch() (no direct JSONL writes)
  - No hardcoded batch sizes (loaded from config)
  - Correlation IDs bound to logger context
  - Proper naming conventions (PascalCase classes, snake_case functions)

- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS
  - Files placed correctly: `src/coordinator.py`, `src/models/config.py`, `tests/unit/test_batch_processing.py`
  - Test file mirrors source structure

  - AC3: JSON configurable ✓ (SystemParams loads from file)
  - AC4: Progress tracking ✓ (progress_tracker integration)
  - AC5: Checkpointing/resumability ✓ (checkpoint_manager + tests)

### Requirements Traceability

| AC | Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|----|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Configurable batch size for parallel department processing | `test_init_loads_batch_config`, `test_batch_size_configurations` | ✓ |
| 2 | Default batch size = 5 | `BatchConfig` field defaults, config tests | ✓ |
| 3 | Batch size in system params JSON | `test_init_creates_default_config`, SystemParams model | ✓ |
| 4 | Progress tracking shows batch info | `process_departments_in_batches` integration | ✓ |
| 5 | Checkpointing between batches | `test_process_departments_with_resume`, `test_process_departments_basic` | ✓ |

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

**AC1 Test Scenario:**
- **Given** a system with department_discovery_batch_size configured to 7
- **When** CLICoordinator is initialized
- **Then** the batch size is loaded and validated (1-99 range enforced)

**AC5 Test Scenario:**
- **Given** a processing run with batches 0-1 complete (checkpoints saved)
- **When** `get_resume_point()` is called
- **Then** returns batch index 2 (next incomplete batch)
- **And** processing resumes from batch 2 onward

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed During Review:**
- [x] Moved uuid import to module level in coordinator.py for better performance

**Already Excellent (No Changes Needed):**

- [ ] Consider adding performance benchmark test to measure batch processing overhead at different sizes

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** - No security concerns identified

- ✓ No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- ✓ Configuration file path validation (FileNotFoundError with helpful message)
- ✓ Batch size bounds checking (1-99) prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- ✓ Structured logging masks credentials automatically
- ✓ No user input directly executed
