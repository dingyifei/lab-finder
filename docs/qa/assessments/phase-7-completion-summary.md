## Quality Score Calculation

**Formula:**
```
quality_score = 100 - (20 × FAIL_count) - (10 × CONCERNS_count) - (2 × MINOR_count)
```

**Breakdown:**
- Base score: 100
- Critical issues (FAIL): 0 × 20 = -0 points
- Medium concerns: 0 × 10 = -0 points
- Minor improvements: 4 × 2 = -8 points
- **Final Score: 92/100**

**Grade Scale:**
- 90-100: A (Excellent)
- 80-89: B (Good)
- 70-79: C (Acceptable)
- 60-69: D (Needs Improvement)
- <60: F (Fail)

**Result: A (Excellent)**
