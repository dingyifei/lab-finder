# Review notes
review_notes: |
  This story exemplifies excellent software engineering practices. The implementation demonstrates:

  - Thoughtful performance optimizations (exact match pre-filtering)
  - Comprehensive test coverage with critical edge case validation
  - Production-ready code quality with proper error handling
  - Clear documentation explaining design decisions
  - Type safety throughout

  The developer went above and beyond by fixing pre-existing type errors from previous stories
  and implementing 7 tests (vs 6 required minimum). The critical edge case test (#6: high-confidence
  "no" match) shows deep understanding of the business logic.

  Minor enhancement opportunities noted (telemetry, configurable rate limits) but these are
  non-blocking optimizations, not issues.

  Approved for production use with confidence.
