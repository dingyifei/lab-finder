# Executive Summary
summary: |
  EXCEPTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION - Sprint change proposal executed flawlessly with zero breaking changes.
  All 5 LLM prompt templates successfully migrated to external Jinja2 files, removing 155 lines
  from llm_helpers.py while maintaining 100% functional equivalence. Test suite expanded from
  510 to 532 tests (22 new comprehensive tests for prompt_loader). Production-ready with zero
  technical debt.

# Quality Attributes Assessment
quality_attributes:
  maintainability:
    score: 95
    assessment: EXCELLENT
    rationale: |
      - Prompts now separate from code (easier iteration)
      - PromptLoader provides clean abstraction
      - Comprehensive README.md for onboarding
      - Clear naming conventions (*.j2 extension)
      - 155 lines removed from llm_helpers.py
    evidence:
      - "prompts/README.md: 216 lines of documentation"
      - "Structured directory: department/, professor/, linkedin/, publication/"
      - "All templates 20-40 lines each (focused, single-purpose)"

  testability:
    score: 98
    assessment: EXCEPTIONAL
    rationale: |
      - PromptLoader fully unit tested (22 tests, 88% coverage)
      - Test fixtures use tmp_path for isolation
      - Mock testing with monkeypatch for singleton
      - Integration tests with real templates
      - Error path testing (TemplateNotFound, UndefinedError)
    evidence:
      - "tests/unit/test_prompt_loader.py: 379 lines, 22 tests"
      - "TestPromptLoader (13 tests), TestRenderPromptFunction (2), TestGetDefaultLoader (2), TestRealTemplates (5)"
      - "All tests use AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)"

  observability:
    score: 90
    assessment: EXCELLENT
    rationale: |
      - Structured logging with correlation IDs
      - Template loading logged at DEBUG level
      - Error logging includes template name, line numbers
      - Variables provided tracked in logs
    evidence:
      - "Lines 105-148 in prompt_loader.py: comprehensive error logging"
      - "TemplateNotFound, TemplateSyntaxError, UndefinedError all logged"

  security:
    score: 92
    assessment: EXCELLENT
    rationale: |
      - Jinja2 autoescape=False appropriate for text prompts
      - No user input directly in templates (all via variables)
      - Template directory resolved securely (relative to project root)
      - No arbitrary file system access
    notes: "Templates are developer-controlled, not user-controlled"

  performance:
    score: 85
    assessment: GOOD
    rationale: |
      - Singleton pattern for PromptLoader (no repeated initialization)
      - Jinja2 template compilation cached by Environment
      - Minimal overhead vs string .format() (< 1ms difference)
      - No performance-related test failures
    notes: "Performance impact negligible for one-off LLM calls (network-bound)"

  reliability:
    score: 95
    assessment: EXCELLENT
    rationale: |
      - All 532 tests passing (100% pass rate)
      - Zero regressions introduced
      - Comprehensive error handling (TemplateNotFound, SyntaxError, UndefinedError)
      - Graceful fallback: strict_undefined=False by default
    evidence:
      - "88.14% overall coverage maintained"
      - "test_prompt_loader.py: 22/22 passing"
