# Quality Gate: Story 2.3 - Department Relevance Filtering

schema: 1
story: "2.3"
story_title: "Department Relevance Filtering"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Exemplary implementation with complete test coverage (28 tests), all ACs validated including explicit verification of logging and progress tracking. Performance characteristics appropriate for MVP scope. Production-ready reference implementation."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No hardcoded credentials, proper SDK usage, no SQL injection risks. Minor LLM prompt injection theoretically possible but low impact (incorrect filtering only)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Sequential processing appropriate for MVP scope (20-50 departments = 40-250s). Clear optimization path documented for future scale needs (100+ departments). Performance optimization properly deferred to real-world usage data."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation, retry logic with exponential backoff, checkpointing for resume capability. All edge cases covered."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exemplary code organization, type hints throughout, structured logging. Refactored during review to eliminate 60+ lines of code duplication. Reference implementation quality."

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "src/utils/llm_helpers.py"
    change: "Extracted _extract_json_from_markdown() helper to eliminate 60+ lines of duplicated JSON parsing logic"
    impact: "Improved maintainability and reduced risk of inconsistent parsing across 5 LLM helper functions"
    performed_by: "Quinn (QA)"

  - file: "src/agents/university_discovery.py"
    change: "Refined edge case keyword matching to use exact matches instead of broad substring matching"
    impact: "Prevents false positives (e.g., 'Computer Science' flagged as generic because it contains 'science')"
    performed_by: "Quinn (QA)"

  - file: "tests/unit/test_department_filter.py"
    change: "Added 6 verification tests (28 total) for explicit logging and progress tracking validation"
    impact: "Closed AC4 and AC7 test coverage gaps, achieving 100% AC coverage with explicit verification"
