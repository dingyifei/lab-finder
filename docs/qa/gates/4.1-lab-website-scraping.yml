  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security-sensitive operations. Data quality flags properly track scraping issues. URL validation prevents injection attacks.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async/await pattern for I/O operations. Retry logic with exponential backoff. Configurable batch sizes (default: 10). Timeout set to 30s per page.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful degradation for missing websites. Checkpoint-based resumability. Error handling with fallback to minimal Lab records. Data quality flags track all issues.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns. Well-documented code. 100% type hint coverage. Ruff and mypy compliant. Follows all coding standards.'
