  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "User config files properly gitignored for PII protection; example files provided as safe templates; schema validation prevents injection attacks"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Schema caching optimization reduces file reads from O(n) to O(1); validation at startup is one-time cost; no bottlenecks identified"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling; clear user-facing error messages; 26 tests cover edge cases; FormatChecker ensures URI validation"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Structured logging added; excellent test coverage; clear code organization; type hints on all functions; well-documented schemas"
