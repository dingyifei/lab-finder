recommendations:
  immediate: [] # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: 'Consider extracting hardcoded research keywords from parse_professor_elements to config or use LLM-based extraction'
      refs: ['src/agents/professor_filter.py:127-132']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Improves flexibility for different research domains'
    - action: 'Add direct unit test for parse_professor_elements helper function'
      refs: ['src/agents/professor_filter.py:75-147']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Currently tested indirectly; direct test would improve test clarity'
    - action: 'Consider extracting URL validation logic to shared utility function'
      refs: ['src/agents/professor_filter.py:177-183', 'src/agents/professor_filter.py:308-314']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Reduces code duplication (used in 2 places)'

strengths:
  - 'Correct ClaudeSDKClient usage with setting_sources=None (prevents codebase context injection)'
  - 'Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation'
  - 'Excellent test coverage (17 tests, all passing)'
  - 'Proper async/await patterns throughout'
  - 'Data quality tracking with well-defined flags'
  - 'Type hints on all functions (mypy passes)'
  - 'Retry logic with tenacity (3 attempts, exponential backoff)'
  - 'Structured logging with correlation IDs'
