# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Config validation prevents injection. Manual override parsing includes graceful JSON error handling. Logging sanitizes raw LLM responses."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "O(1) validation, O(n) stats calculation, efficient dict lookup for overrides. Borderline report skips generation when unnecessary."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful degradation with neutral defaults (confidence=50). Comprehensive data quality flagging. 7+ edge cases handled."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns. Type-safe with Pydantic validation. Comprehensive docstrings. Proper mocking in tests."

# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  This story represents exceptional software engineering quality and is a model implementation.

  PASS criteria met:
  ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
  ✓ 32 tests with 100% pass rate
  ✓ Comprehensive edge case handling (7+ scenarios)
  ✓ Production-grade error handling
  ✓ No security concerns
  ✓ No performance bottlenecks
  ✓ Excellent code organization and maintainability
  ✓ 100% requirements traceability

  Minor style issues (18 line-length warnings) are non-blocking and represent formatting
  preferences rather than functional defects. These can be addressed in future refactoring
  without impacting quality or functionality.

  Quality score: 95/100 (-5 for style warnings)
  Risk level: LOW
  Recommended action: Mark story as DONE and proceed to next story
