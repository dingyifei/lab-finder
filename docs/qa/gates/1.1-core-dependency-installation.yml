# Quality Gate Decision: Story 1.1 - Core Dependency Installation
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.1"
story_title: "Core Dependency Installation"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with good implementation quality. Primary concern is significant version drift from Architecture Tech Stack specification (16 dependencies with version increases including 3 major version bumps). Requires architectural review and baseline documentation update."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

    high: 0
    medium: 1  # Version drift
    low: 2     # Both addressed during review
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Update Architecture Tech Stack Table to document actual installed versions"
      - "Conduct compatibility testing for multi-agent orchestration with newer dependency versions"
    monitor:
      - "Track future dependency version drift from documented baseline"
      - "Establish dependency update policy and approval process"

# Evidence
evidence:

# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dependency installation follows secure practices; no credentials exposed; all packages from PyPI trusted source"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "One-time installation overhead acceptable; Playwright chromium-only optimization (~240MB vs 1GB+); pip-compile ensures deterministic resolution"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Version drift from Architecture specification may introduce compatibility issues or behavioral changes in multi-agent orchestration patterns"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Type hints added; comprehensive unit tests created (5/5 passing); well-organized requirements.in; complete documentation"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Update Architecture Tech Stack Table to reflect installed versions as new baseline"
      refs: ["docs/architecture/tech-stack.md"]
      owner: "architect"
      rationale: "Document version drift before Epic 2 implementation to establish clear baseline"
  future:
    - action: "Add automated dependency audit checks to CI/CD pipeline"
      refs: ["Story 1.8 CI/CD Pipeline Setup"]
      owner: "dev"
      rationale: "Proactive monitoring of dependency security and version drift"
    - action: "Evaluate impact of version drift on multi-agent orchestration patterns"
      refs: ["Epic 2+ stories"]
      owner: "architect"
      rationale: "Validate that newer dependency versions don't introduce breaking changes in Claude Agent SDK integration"
