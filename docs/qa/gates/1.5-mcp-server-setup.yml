# Quality Gate Decision
# Story: 1.5 MCP Server Configuration & Testing
# Reviewed by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.5"
story_title: "MCP Server Configuration & Testing"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is solid with excellent test coverage and all 7 ACs met. However, silent credential failures and deferred error handling present minor reliability concerns that should be addressed in Epic 0 validation and Epic 5 & 6 implementation."
