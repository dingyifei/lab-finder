risk_assessment:
  risk_1_asynclimiter_reuse:
    probability: LOW
    impact: LOW
    risk_score: 2
    status: MITIGATED
    mitigation: |
      AsyncLimiter re-use across loops warning is minor. Recommendation:
      Create new DomainRateLimiter instance per orchestrator call if issues arise.
      Not blocking for production.

  risk_2_puppeteer_mcp_stability:
    probability: LOW
    impact: MEDIUM
    risk_score: 3
    status: MITIGATED
    mitigation: |
      Puppeteer MCP validated in Phase 1 experiments and integrated successfully.
      Fallback to Playwright library remains available if issues arise.
      No stability issues detected in testing.

  risk_3_sufficiency_evaluation_accuracy:
    probability: LOW
    impact: LOW
    risk_score: 2
    status: MITIGATED
    mitigation: |
      Strong prompts achieve same goal as thinking parameter.
      Conservative fallback assumes insufficient after 3 failures.
      Data quality flags track evaluation failures.
      No accuracy issues detected in testing.
