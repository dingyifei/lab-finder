nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Pydantic validation for all config inputs. No security-sensitive code touched. Data quality flags properly maintained.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Parallel processing with asyncio.Semaphore achieves 5-10x speedup. Rate limiting prevents API throttling. Batch size=15 provides optimal balance. Performance timing documented (6-12 sec/batch).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling: individual professor failures use inclusive fallback, infrastructure failures re-raise for resumability. Checkpoint-based recovery tested.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code organization with clear separation of concerns. Complete type hints, docstrings, and inline documentation. Self-documenting function names. Story traceability in comments.'

recommendations:
  immediate: [] # None - production ready

  future:
    - action: 'Consider adding metrics collection for batch processing performance'
      refs: ['src/agents/professor_filter.py:1301']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Would enable data-driven optimization of batch_size and max_concurrent params'

    - action: 'Consider circuit breaker pattern if API failures exceed threshold'
      refs: ['src/agents/professor_filter.py:1318']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Could prevent cascading failures during API outages. Not critical given current retry + resumability.'

strengths:
  - 'Exceptional test coverage with 9 targeted integration tests'
  - 'Robust error handling distinguishing individual vs infrastructure failures'
  - 'Parallel processing with semaphore achieves documented 5-10x speedup'
  - 'Complete requirements traceability (all 6 ACs mapped to tests)'
  - 'Production-ready code quality (ruff ✅, mypy ✅, 393 tests passing)'
  - 'Excellent documentation with inline story references'
  - 'Configurable and maintainable design'
