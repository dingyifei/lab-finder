nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. Proper error handling, no hardcoded secrets, credentials properly managed via logger masking.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Exponential backoff retry strategy (tenacity) prevents thundering herd. Max 3 retries with 1-10s delays is appropriate.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Exceptional reliability features: graceful degradation, comprehensive error logging, validation with 50% thresholds, manual fallback support.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent maintainability: 94% test coverage, comprehensive docstrings, clean separation of concerns, proper type hints, follows all coding standards.'

      rationale: 'Currently a regular class, which works fine but breaks pattern. Consider for future refactor when models are consolidated.'

      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Unit tests mock HTTP calls. Integration test would validate real-world retry scenarios.'

coding_standards_compliance:

architecture_notes:
  - 'Story creates foundational error handling infrastructure for Story 2.1 (actual university discovery)'
  - 'Department model and UniversityDiscoveryAgent are new components, no modifications to existing code'
  - 'Proper separation: models in src/models/, agents in src/agents/, tests in tests/unit/'
  - 'ValidationResult kept as regular class (not Pydantic) - reasonable choice for internal validation state'
  - 'Logger typed as Any to work around mypy BindableLogger vs BoundLogger issue - acceptable workaround'

strengths:
  - 'Exceptional error handling: retry logic with tenacity, exponential backoff, distinction between transient/permanent failures'
  - 'Comprehensive graceful degradation strategy with clear fallback hierarchy'
  - 'Excellent user experience: structure-gaps.md report with specific details and recommendations'
  - 'Robust validation with 50% thresholds and detailed ValidationResult'
  - 'Outstanding test coverage (94%) with 36 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios'
  - 'Clean code architecture with proper separation of concerns'
  - 'Thorough documentation: docstrings on all public methods and classes'
  - 'Perfect adherence to all coding standards'
