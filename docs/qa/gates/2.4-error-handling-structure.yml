nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Error handling maintains security posture; no information leakage; SDK provides additional error isolation'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'IMPROVED - SDK error handling more efficient than manual retry decorators; fewer exception handling layers'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'ENHANCED - SDK battle-tested error handling; consistent error patterns; better error observability; preserved manual fallback'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'EXCELLENT - Simplified error paths (SDK → Parse → Fallback → Re-raise); clearer error flow; fewer error paths to test'

error_handling_validation:
  graceful_degradation:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All graceful degradation scenarios work correctly; data quality flags applied; partial data handled'
  retry_logic:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'SDK handles retry logic internally; no manual tenacity decorators needed; more reliable than custom implementation'
  manual_fallback:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Manual fallback configuration fully functional; properly tested; clear documentation'
  validation_thresholds:
    status: PASS
    notes: '50% thresholds enforced correctly; validation blocks pipeline when appropriate; warnings for partial completeness'
  data_quality_tracking:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All quality flags preserved (missing_url, missing_school, etc.); gap reporting generates correctly'
  structured_logging:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive logging with correlation IDs; credential masking preserved; error context captured'
