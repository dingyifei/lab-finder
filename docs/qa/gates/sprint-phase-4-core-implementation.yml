  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'robots.txt compliance, proper user agent, environment variable usage for credentials, no injection risks'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async I/O throughout, per-domain rate limiting (1 req/sec), conservative retry strategy (max 3 attempts), early termination on success'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful degradation with partial data return, comprehensive exception handling, conservative fallbacks, retry logic with exponential backoff'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent documentation, 100% type coverage (mypy strict passing), structured logging with correlation IDs, clean module organization'

strengths:
  - '78% test coverage (exceeds 70% target) with 21 comprehensive tests'
  - 'Zero code quality violations (ruff ✓, mypy strict ✓)'
  - 'Comprehensive multi-stage pattern: WebFetch → Sufficiency → Puppeteer MCP → Re-evaluate'
  - 'Proper MCP architecture via claude/.mcp.json (not Python code)'
  - 'Exceptional NFR compliance across security, performance, reliability, maintainability'
  - 'Zero technical debt - no TODOs, FIXMEs, workarounds, or deferred work'
  - '60% faster than estimate (4 hours vs 10-15 hours estimated)'
  - 'TypedDict usage provides type-safe return values'
  - 'Clean separation of concerns with private helper functions'
