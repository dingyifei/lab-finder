nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent security posture:
      - File permissions 600 on Unix (owner read/write only)
      - Password masking in all CLI prompts
      - Credentials never logged in plain text
      - mask_credential() utility for safe logging
      - .env file excluded from git
      - Error handling doesn't expose credentials
      - Cross-platform security (graceful Windows fallback)
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Efficient credential management:
      - One-time .env loading at startup
      - Minimal file I/O operations
      - Credentials cached in environment variables
      - No performance bottlenecks identified
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Robust error handling:
      - ValueError for missing required credentials
      - Exception handling in save operations
      - Graceful Unix permission failures
      - Auto-creates .env from .env.example
      - 95.6% test pass rate (22/23, 1 platform skip)
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      High quality implementation:
      - Type hints on all function signatures
      - Comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
      - Structured logging throughout
      - Clear separation: Rich for UI, structlog for ops
      - Private methods follow naming conventions
      - 23 comprehensive unit tests
      - Clean, readable code

review_notes: |
  Story 1.3 represents exceptional software engineering with security-first design.

  Key accomplishments:
  - Comprehensive test coverage (23 tests across 7 test classes)
  - Security best practices: file permissions, password masking, no credential logging
  - Structured logging using structlog (proactive inclusion from outset)
  - Cross-platform compatibility (Unix permissions with Windows graceful fallback)
  - Clean code architecture with type hints and documentation

  The implementation provides a solid foundation for secure credential management
  in Epic 2+ and critical for Epic 6 LinkedIn integration.

  No refactoring needed - developer followed best practices from Story 1.2 review.
  All linting checks pass. Ready for production use.

  VERIFICATION UPDATE (2025-10-06 21:45):
  Post-implementation type hint improvement verified (Dict[str, Optional[str]]).
  Change assessed as defensive typing enhancement with no breaking impact.
  Tests remain passing (22/23). PASS gate status confirmed and maintained.
