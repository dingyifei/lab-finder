nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. File path handling is safe, JSON parsing uses error handling, no injection vectors.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'O(n) complexity appropriate for use case. Efficient list comprehensions. File I/O properly async.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent error handling in load_manual_additions(). Edge cases handled (empty list, all included/excluded). Graceful degradation when borderline report missing.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear function names, excellent documentation, complete type hints, good separation of concerns, no code duplication.'

  - 'Comprehensive edge case handling (empty lists, all included/excluded scenarios)'
  - 'UTF-8 encoding correctly applied for Windows compatibility'
  - 'Strong separation of concerns across all 5 functions'
  - 'Proper structlog usage with correlation IDs throughout'
  - 'Complete type hints (mypy passes without errors)'
  - '17 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate'
  - 'Excellent documentation and docstrings'
