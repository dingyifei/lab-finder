# Review notes
notes: |
  Excellent testing infrastructure implementation. All 7 acceptance criteria fully satisfied.

  Strengths:
  - Comprehensive pytest configuration with appropriate markers and coverage settings
  - Educational example tests demonstrating AAA pattern, async, mocking, parametrization
  - Well-documented test fixtures with valid/invalid examples
  - Clear README documentation with practical examples

  Issue Resolved During Review:
  - Missing type hints in test files violated coding standard "Always type hint function signatures"
  - Fixed by adding return type annotations to all test functions
  - Verified: All 19 tests pass, mypy strict mode passes, ruff linter passes

  Coverage Note:
  - Current 0% coverage is expected and acceptable for infrastructure setup story
  - Coverage target of 70% is appropriate goal for future Epic 2+ development
  - Infrastructure successfully enables test-driven development going forward

  This story establishes a solid foundation for comprehensive testing in Epic 2 and beyond.
