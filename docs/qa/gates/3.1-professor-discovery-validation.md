## Validation Process

### Phase 1: Initial PO Validation (Sarah)

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Tool:** validate-next-story task workflow
**Scope:** 10-step comprehensive validation checklist

#### Validation Steps Completed:
1. ‚úÖ Template Completeness - All sections present, no placeholders
2. ‚úÖ File Structure - Clear paths, consistent with project structure
3. ‚úÖ UI/Frontend - N/A (CLI-only)
4. ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Coverage - All 8 AC mapped to tasks
5. ‚úÖ Testing Instructions - 7 test cases with code examples
6. ‚úÖ Security Considerations - N/A for this story
7. ‚úÖ Task Sequencing - Logical dependencies validated
8. ‚ö†Ô∏è Anti-Hallucination - 3 critical concerns identified
9. ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Readiness - Medium confidence due to API uncertainties
10. üìã Validation Report Generated

#### Critical Concerns Raised:
1. **SDK API Patterns** - AssistantMessage/TextBlock classes not in architecture docs
2. **Parallel Processing Conflict** - asyncio.gather() vs SDK parallel agents
3. **WebFetch/WebSearch Usage** - Configuration clarity needed

**Initial Assessment:** NO-GO (Score: 6.5/10)

---

### Phase 2: Architect Verification (Winston)

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Tool:** Context7 MCP - Official Claude Agent SDK Python docs
**Scope:** Verify SDK API accuracy against official documentation

#### Verification Results:

##### ‚úÖ ISSUE 1 RESOLVED: SDK API Patterns ARE CORRECT

**Finding:** AssistantMessage and TextBlock are **official SDK classes**

**Evidence from Official Docs:**
```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, AssistantMessage, TextBlock

async for message in query(prompt="Hello Claude"):
    if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
        for block in message.content:
            if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                print(block.text)
```

**Source:** Claude Agent SDK Python README (official)

**Conclusion:** Story 3.1's code patterns (lines 207-276) are accurate and follow official SDK documentation. Architecture docs were simply incomplete.

**Action:** None required - story is correct as written

---

##### ‚úÖ ISSUE 2 RESOLVED: Parallel Processing Conflict Fixed

**Finding:** Architecture docs already updated to deprecate SDK parallel agent pattern

**Evidence:** `docs/architecture/implementation-patterns.md` line 138:
```python
# NOTE: This pattern is DEPRECATED - use asyncio.gather() instead (see Story 3.1 v0.5)
# Application-level parallel execution with asyncio.gather() provides better control
```

**Conclusion:** Story 3.1's asyncio.gather() approach is the correct architectural decision.

**Action:** None required - already resolved

---

##### ‚úÖ ISSUE 3 VERIFIED: WebFetch/WebSearch Are Real Tools

**Finding:** WebFetch and WebSearch are **Claude Code built-in tools**

**Evidence from Official Docs:**
- WebFetch Tool - Fetches content from URLs with AI processing
- WebSearch Tool - Performs web searches and returns formatted results

**Configuration:**
```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["WebFetch", "WebSearch", "Read", "Write"],
    ...
)
```

**Conclusion:** Story 3.1's approach is correct. These are real Claude Code tools.

**Action:** Added clarification comments to story code examples (v0.6)

---

### Phase 3: Story Updates (v0.6)

**Updates Applied:**

1. **Added WebFetch/WebSearch Clarification:**
   - Added inline comment: "Built-in Claude Code tools (verified in official docs)"
   - Confirmed in ClaudeAgentOptions configuration example

2. **Added File Naming Scope Note:**
   - Clarified `professor_filter.py` scope across stories 3.1 and 3.2
   - Explained Story 3.1 implements discovery, Story 3.2 adds filtering

3. **Updated Change Log:**
   - Added v0.6 entry documenting verification and approval

4. **Updated Status:**
   - Changed from "Draft" to "Approved"
   - Added note: "verified against official Claude Agent SDK docs, ready for implementation"
