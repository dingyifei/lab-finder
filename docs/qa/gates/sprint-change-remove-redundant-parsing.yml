implementation_summary:
  code_changes:
    - file: 'src/agents/lab_research.py'
      impact: 'Removed 52 lines of redundant parsing (-49 net)'
      validation: 'Verified parse_lab_content() completely removed'
    - file: 'src/agents/professor_discovery.py'
      impact: 'Simplified dict conversion (+3 lines, clearer logic)'
      validation: 'Verified direct dict extraction without round-trip conversion'

  documentation_changes:
    - file: 'CLAUDE.md'
      impact: 'Added coding standard #18 for type guarantee trust'
      validation: 'Confirmed pattern documented for future work'
    - file: 'docs/architecture/implementation-patterns.md'
      impact: 'Added "Trust Type Guarantees" section with examples'
      validation: 'Clear correct vs incorrect usage patterns documented'
    - file: 'docs/stories/4.5.web-scraping-error-handling.md'
      impact: 'Added "Retry Logic and Type Guarantees" section'
      validation: 'Type contract clearly documented'

  test_changes:
    - file: 'tests/unit/test_lab_research.py'
      impact: 'Removed 3 obsolete tests + unused pytest import'
      validation: 'Tests for deleted function properly removed'
    - file: 'tests/integration/test_professor_discovery.py'
      impact: 'Fixed mock to return dict instead of string'
      validation: 'Mock now matches actual ScrapingResult TypedDict'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security implications. Type safety actually improved by trusting guarantees and allowing clean failures.'

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Minor performance improvement by removing wasteful dict→JSON→dict conversions in professor_discovery.py'

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Improved reliability through cleaner failure paths enabling proper checkpoint recovery. Removing redundant checks prevents silent errors.'

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Exceptional maintainability improvement: -49 net lines, clearer logic, established pattern prevents future technical debt'
