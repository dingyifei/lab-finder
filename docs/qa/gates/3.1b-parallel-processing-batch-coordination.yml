# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - no sensitive data handling, no auth logic in scope"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimal async design with proper Semaphore-based concurrency control"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling with graceful degradation. Progress tracking refactored to use finally block for improved reliability"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code, comprehensive tests, good documentation following all coding standards"

# Review notes
review_notes:
  refactoring_performed:
    - file: "src/agents/professor_filter.py"
      change: "Moved progress tracking to finally block (lines 522-525)"
      reason: "Ensures progress updates occur even if exceptions escape try-except"
      impact: "Improved reliability and debuggability"

  strengths:
    - "Clean asyncio.gather() with Semaphore pattern"
    - "Hierarchical correlation IDs for distributed tracing"
    - "Comprehensive test coverage (7 tests covering all ACs + edge cases)"
    - "Proper error handling with graceful degradation"
    - "Follows all coding standards"

  test_coverage:
    - "AC1: test_parallel_discovery_with_multiple_departments"
    - "AC2: test_semaphore_limits_concurrent_execution"
    - "AC3: test_progress_tracking_updates"
    - "AC4: Implementation logging (line 490)"
    - "AC5: test_failed_department_doesnt_stop_processing, test_all_departments_fail"
    - "Edge cases: empty list, single department"
