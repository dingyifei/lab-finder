<task>
Provide:
1. Confidence score (0-100) indicating research alignment
2. Detailed reasoning explaining the score
3. Key factors listing specific matching elements

Confidence score should reflect:
- Strength of research overlap (strong/moderate/weak)
- Number of matching research areas
- Specificity of match (direct vs. tangential)
- Certainty in interpretation

Include "key_factors" listing specific matching elements from the professor's research.
Include "confidence_explanation" explaining why this confidence level was assigned.
