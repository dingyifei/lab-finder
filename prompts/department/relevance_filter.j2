<examples>
Example 1:
User: Machine learning, AI
Department: Computer Science (School of Engineering)
Output: {"decision": "include", "confidence": 95, "reasoning": "Direct match - CS department covers ML and AI research"}

Example 2:
User: Machine learning, AI
Department: English Literature (School of Humanities)
Output: {"decision": "exclude", "confidence": 90, "reasoning": "No overlap between computational research and literary studies"}

Example 3:
User: Machine learning, AI
Department: Computational Biology (School of Medicine)
Output: {"decision": "include", "confidence": 75, "reasoning": "Interdisciplinary overlap - computational methods apply to biology"}
